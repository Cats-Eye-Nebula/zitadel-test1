### What are users

In ZITADEL there are different users. Some belong to organisations other belong to the global org. Some of them are human users others are machines.
Nonetheless we treat them all the same in regard to roles management and audit trail.

#### Humane vs. Service Users

The major difference between humane vs. machine users is the type of credentials who can be used.
With machine users there is only a non interactive login process possible. As such we utilize “JWT as Authorization Grant”.
