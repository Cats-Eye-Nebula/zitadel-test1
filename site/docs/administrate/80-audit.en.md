### What about Audit

ZITADEL is built upon the concept of Event sourcing. With this ZITADEL can track each operation of all objects it maintains over an infinite amount of time. The only limit is the storage system.

With these events ZITADEL can provide you with a super detailed audit trail where you can see who changed what and when.

Over the next few releases we will steadily enhance and build features tailored to reporting and audit.

> It is important to mention that even if ZITADEL does not yet supply the Grapical User Interface for certain audit aspects it still has all the data to generate these reports later on!

> TBA General Audit capabilities
