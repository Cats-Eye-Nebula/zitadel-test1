### What is Console

Console is the ZITADEL Graphical User Interface.

**Users** can manage some information by their own.

- profile information
- credentials
- identity providers

Users (**org owners**) who manage organisations do this also with Console.

- Organisation settings (policies, domains, idp's)
- Manage users
- Manage projects, clients and roles
- Give access to users

For the **IAM Administrators** there is also a section in Console solely intended to manage the system.

- Check failed events
- Reset read models
- Define system policies

### Technologies

Console is built with Angular and interfaces with ZITADEL by utilizing the GRPC APIs over GRPC-web.
