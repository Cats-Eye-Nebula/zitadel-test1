#### Verify your domain name (optional)

When you verify your domain you get the benefit that your [organisations](administrate#Organisations) [users](administrate#Users) can use this domain as **preferred loginname**. You find a more detailed explanation [How ZITADEL handles usernames](administrate#How_ZITADEL_handles_usernames).

The verification process is documented [here](administrate#Verify_a_domain_name)

#### Add Users to your organisation

To add new user just follow [this guide](administrate#Create_User)

#### Setup an application

First [create a project](administrate#Create_a_project)

Then create within this [project](administrate#Projects) a [new client](administrate#Manage_clients)

The wizard should provide some guidance what client is the proper for you. If you are still unsure consult our [Integration Guide](integrate#Overview)
