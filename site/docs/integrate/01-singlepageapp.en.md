### SPA Protocol and Flow recommendation

If your [client](administrate#Clients) is a single page application (SPA) we recommend that you use [Authorization Code](documentation#Authorization_Code) in combination with [Proof Key for Code Exchange](documentation#Proof_Key_for_Code_Exchange).

This flow has great support with most modern languages and frameworks and is the recommended default.

> In the OIDC and OAuth world this **client profile** is called "user-agent-based application"
