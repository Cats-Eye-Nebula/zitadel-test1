### What next?

You have successfully integrated ZITADEL in your Angular Application! Now you can proceed implementing our APIs to include Authorization. Refer to our [Docs](apis#Authentication_API) or checkout our Console Code on [Github](https://github.com/caos/zitadel) which is using GRPC to access data.

For more information about creating an angular application we refer to [Angular](https://angular.io/start) and for more information about the used oauth/oidc library consider reading their docs at [angular-oauth2-oidc](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc).
