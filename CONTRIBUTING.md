## How to contribute

We strongly recomend to talk to us before you start contributing to streamline our and your work.

We accept contributions through pull requests. You need a github account for that. If you are unfamiliar with git have a look at Github's documentation on [creating forks](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [creating pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Please draft the pull request as soon as possible. Go through the following checklist before you submit the final pull request:

1. Create a feature branch from the `main`-branch
1. Make your changes on the new branch
1. [Merge](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) the lastet commit of the `main`-branch
1. Use [Semantic Release commit messages](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#type) to simplify creation of release notes. In the title of the pull request correct tagging is required and will be requested by the reviewers.
1. Request a [review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) from one of the authors. The reviewers will provide you feedback and approve your changes as soon as they are satisfied.

## Contribute

The code consists of the following parts:

| name | description | language | where to find |
|---|---|---|---|
| backend | Service that serves the grpc(-web) and RESTful API  | [go](https://go.dev) | [API implementation](./internal/api/grpc) |
| console | Frontend the user inertacts with after he is logged in | [Angular](https://angular.io), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) | [./console](./console) |
| login | Server side rendered frontend the user interacts with during login | [go](https://go.dev), [go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) | [./internal/api/ui/login](./internal/api/ui/login) |
| API definitions | Specifications of the API | [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) | [./proto/zitadel](./proto/zitadel) |
| docs | Project documentation made with docusaurus | [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) | [./docs](./docs) |

Please validate and test the code before you contribute.

### Backend / Login

To keep the code clean and understandable we use [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run). We recommend to format the code with this linter while working on ZITADEL to simplify the review process. The configuration is locaed [here](./.golangci.yaml).

To start the backend with a debugger run the [`main.go`-file](./main.go) located in the root of ZITADEL and provide the arguments and env-variables from below. Ensure that the database is running by running `docker compose -f ./build/local/docker-compose.yml up db`. For additional information please use the documentation of your IDE.

Make sure to use the following configurations:

TODO document workflow

### Console

<!-- TODO: ask maxpe for infos -->

### API Definitions

Ensure the provided code meets the [offical style guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style).

The following docker command builds the grpc stub into the correct folders:

```bash
docker build -f build/grpc/Dockerfile -t zitadel-base:local . \
    && docker build -f build/zitadel/Dockerfile . -t zitadel-go-base --target go-copy -o .
```
