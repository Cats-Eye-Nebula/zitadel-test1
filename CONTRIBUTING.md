## How to contribute

We strongly recommend to [talk to us](https://zitadel.com/contact) before you start contributing to streamline our and your work.

We accept contributions through pull requests. You need a github account for that. If you are unfamiliar with git have a look at Github's documentation on [creating forks](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [creating pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Please draft the pull request as soon as possible. Go through the following checklist before you submit the final pull request:

### Submit a Pull Request (PR)

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [zitadel/zitadel](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel) repository on GitHub
2. On your fork, commit your changes to a new branch

`git checkout -b my-fix-branch main`

3. Make your changes following the [guidelines](#contribute) in this guide. Make sure that all tests pass.

4. Commit the changes on the new branch

`git commit --all`

5. [Merge](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) the latest commit of the `main`-branch

6. Push the changes to your branch on Github

`git push origin my-fix-branch`

7. Use [Semantic Release commit messages](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#type) to simplify creation of release notes. In the title of the pull request [correct tagging](#commit-messages) is required and will be requested by the reviewers.

8.  On GitHub, [send a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) to `zitadel:main`. Request review from one of the maintainers.

### Reviewing a Pull Request

The reviewers will provide you feedback and approve your changes as soon as they are satisfied. If we ask you for changes in the code, you can follow the [GitHub Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) to incorporate feedback in your pull request.

### Backend / Login

To keep the code clean and understandable we use [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run). We recommend to format the code with this linter while working on ZITADEL to simplify the review process. The configuration is located [here](./.golangci.yaml).

To start the backend with a debugger run the [`main.go`-file](./main.go) located in the root of ZITADEL and provide the arguments and env-variables from below. Ensure that the database is running by running `docker compose -f ./build/local/docker-compose.yml up db`. For additional information please use the documentation of your IDE.

Make sure to use the following configurations:

<!-- TODO: document workflow -->

### Console

Change to the console directory

```bash
cd ./console
```

Run the database and the backend locally

```bash
docker compose --file ../e2e/docker-compose.yaml up --detach db zitadel
```

Console loads its environment from the file console/src/assets/environment.json.
Load it from your local target system.

```bash
curl -O ./src/assets/environment.json http://localhost:8080/ui/console/assets/environment.json
```

To generate source files from protos, run the following command
```
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f ../build/console/Dockerfile . -t zitadel-npm-base --target npm-copy -o internal/api/ui/console/static
```

To run the console locally, run `npm install` and then `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can now also run end-to-end tests interactively.
Open a new shell and change to the e2e directory

```bash
cd ./e2e
```

Start cypress and point it to your local dev server:

```bash
CYPRESS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4200 npm start
```

### API Definitions

Ensure the provided code meets the [official style guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style).

The following docker command builds the grpc stub into the correct folders:

```bash
docker build -f build/grpc/Dockerfile -t zitadel-base:local . \
    && docker build -f build/zitadel/Dockerfile . -t zitadel-go-base --target go-copy -o .
```

### Testing

<!-- TODO: how to run E2E tests -->

## Contribute Docs

Project documentation is made with docusaurus and is located under [./docs](./docs).
Please refer to the [README](./docs/README.md) for more information and local testing.

When making a pull request use `docs(<scope>): <short summary>` as title for the semantic release.
Scope can be left empty (omit the brackets) or refer to the top navigation sections.

## Contribute Internationalization

ZITADEL loads translations from four files:

- [Console texts](./console/src/assets/i18n)
- [Login interface](./internal/api/ui/login/static/i18n)
- [Email notification](./internal/notification/static/i18n)
- [Common texts](./internal/static/i18n) for success or error toasts

You may edit the texts in these files or create a new file for additional language support. Make sure you set the locale (ISO 639-1 code) as the name of the new language file.
