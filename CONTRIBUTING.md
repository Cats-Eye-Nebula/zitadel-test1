## How to contribute

We strongly recommend to [talk to us](https://zitadel.com/contact) before you start contributing to streamline our and your work.

We accept contributions through pull requests. You need a github account for that. If you are unfamiliar with git have a look at Github's documentation on [creating forks](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [creating pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Please draft the pull request as soon as possible. Go through the following checklist before you submit the final pull request:

### Submit a Pull Request (PR)

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [zitadel/zitadel](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel) repository on GitHub
2. On your fork, commit your changes to a new branch

`git checkout -b my-fix-branch main`

3. Make your changes following the [guidelines](#contribute) in this guide. Make sure that all tests pass.

4. Commit the changes on the new branch

`git commit --all`

5. [Merge](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) the latest commit of the `main`-branch

6. Push the changes to your branch on Github

`git push origin my-fix-branch`

7. Use [Semantic Release commit messages](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#type) to simplify creation of release notes. In the title of the pull request [correct tagging](#commit-messages) is required and will be requested by the reviewers.

8.  On GitHub, [send a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) to `zitadel:main`. Request review from one of the maintainers.

### Reviewing a Pull Request

The reviewers will provide you feedback and approve your changes as soon as they are satisfied. If we ask you for changes in the code, you can follow the [GitHub Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) to incorporate feedback in your pull request.

Please validate and test the code before you contribute.

We add the label "good first issue" for problems we think are a good starting point to contribute to ZITADEL.

### Backend / Login

To keep the code clean and understandable we use [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run). We recommend to format the code with this linter while working on ZITADEL to simplify the review process. The configuration is located [here](./.golangci.yaml).

To start the backend with a debugger run the [`main.go`-file](./main.go) located in the root of ZITADEL and provide the arguments and env-variables from below. Ensure that the database is running by running `docker compose -f ./build/local/docker-compose.yml up db`. For additional information please use the documentation of your IDE.

Make sure to use the following configurations:

<!-- TODO: document workflow -->

### Console

Run the database and the latests backend locally.


```bash
# Change to the console directory
cd ./console

# You just need the db and the zitadel services to develop the console against.
docker compose --file ../e2e/docker-compose.yaml up --detach db zitadel
```

When the backend is ready, you have the latest zitadel exposed at http://localhost:8080.
You can now run a local development server with live code reloading at http://localhost:4200.
To allow console access via http://localhost:4200, you have to configure the ZITADEL backend.

1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ui/console/projects.
2. When propted, login with *zitadel-admin@zitadel.localhost* and *Password1!*.
3. Select the *ZITADEL* project.
3. Select the *Console* application.
4. Select *Redirect Settings*
5. Add *http://localhost:4200/auth/callback* to the *Redirect URIs*
6. Add *http://localhost:4200/signedout* to the *Post Logout URIs*
7. Select the *Save* button

You can run the local console development server now.

```bash
# Console loads its target environment from the file console/src/assets/environment.json.
# Load it from the backend.
curl -O ./src/assets/environment.json http://localhost:8080/ui/console/assets/environment.json

# Generate source files from Protos
npm run generate

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
Make some changes to the source code and see how the browser is automatically reloaded.
After making changes to the code, you should run the end-to-end-tests.
Open another shell.

```bash
# Change to the e2e directory
cd ./e2e

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests in a headless browser
npm run e2e:dev
```

You can also open the test suite interactively for fast success feedback on specific tests.

```bash
# Run all tests in a headless browser
npm run open:dev
```

### API Definitions

Ensure the provided code meets the [official style guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style).

The following docker command builds the grpc stub into the correct folders:

```bash
docker build -f build/grpc/Dockerfile -t zitadel-base:local . \
    && docker build -f build/zitadel/Dockerfile . -t zitadel-go-base --target go-copy -o .
```

### Testing

<!-- TODO: how to run E2E tests -->

## Contribute Docs

Project documentation is made with docusaurus and is located under [./docs](./docs).
Please refer to the [README](./docs/README.md) for more information and local testing.

When making a pull request use `docs(<scope>): <short summary>` as title for the semantic release.
Scope can be left empty (omit the brackets) or refer to the top navigation sections.

## Contribute Internationalization

ZITADEL loads translations from four files:

- [Console texts](./console/src/assets/i18n)
- [Login interface](./internal/api/ui/login/static/i18n)
- [Email notification](./internal/notification/static/i18n)
- [Common texts](./internal/static/i18n) for success or error toasts

You may edit the texts in these files or create a new file for additional language support. Make sure you set the locale (ISO 639-1 code) as the name of the new language file.
