## What Is It

Zitadel is a Cloud Native IAM with a clear focus toward federated Authentication and Authorization. We @caos firmly believe that a modern IAM should be easy to deploy and operate even at cloudscale seizes. One thing zitadel that seperates zitadel even thurder from most other solutions is that it is built around the assumption that each operation should be reproducable at infinit lengt.

## How Does It Work

## Our Vision

- Create an IAM ...
  - where each operation is auditable over a long time period
  - which can be used as SaaS or a dedicated instace
  - with security features available by default and not hidden behind a paid tier
  - based and available on opensource librarys
  - designed to be a cloud-native application
  - that is easy to operate and scale scale
  - pricing....(some words to that)
