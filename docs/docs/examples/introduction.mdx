### Others

If we do not provide an example, SDK or guide, we strongly recommend using existing authentication libraries for your language or framework instead of building your own.
Certified libraries have undergone rigorous testing and validation to ensure high security and reliability.
There are many recommended libraries available, this saves time and ensures that users' data is well-protected.
