Get started with ZITADEL quickly by reading a guide or by cloning a [ZITADEL example](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aexamples+org%3Azitadel) repo.

We try to help you as much as possible by providing examples for different programming languages and frameworks.
To make it better understandable we have defined a scope that has to be included in the examples.

You can find more about it here:
