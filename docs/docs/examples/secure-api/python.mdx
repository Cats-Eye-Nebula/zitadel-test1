import AppJWT from "../imports/_app_jwt.mdx";
import ServiceuserJWT from "../imports/_serviceuser_jwt.mdx";
import ServiceuserRole from "../imports/_serviceuser_role.mdx";
import SetupPython from "../imports/_setup_python.mdx";

This integration guide demonstrates the recommended way to incorporate ZITADEL into your Python service.
It explains how to check the token validity in the API and how to check for permissions.

By the end of this guide, your application will have three different endpoint which are public, private(valid token) and private-scoped(valid token with specific role).

## ZITADEL setup

Before we can start building our application, we have to do a few configuration steps in ZITADEL Console.

### Create application

<AppJWT />

### Create Serviceuser

<ServiceuserJWT />

### Give Serviceuser an authorization

<ServiceuserRole />

### Prerequisites

At the end you should have the following for the API:

- Issuer, something like `https://example.zitadel.cloud` or `http://localhost:8080`
- `.json`-key-file for the API, from the application
- ID of the project

And the following from the Serviceuser:

- `.json`-key-file from the serviceuser

## Setup new Python service

### Setup Python

<SetupPython />

### Creating a new project

To create a new Python project, run the following command:

```bash
python new my-python-project
```

This will create a new directory called `my-python-project` with a basic Python project structure.

### Project structure

Python projects are structured as follows:

```
my-python-project/
├── .python/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
```

- `.python/`: Contains the production build of your project.
- `src/`: Contains the source code of your project.
- `src/index.ts`: The entry point of your Python service.
- `package.json`: The npm package configuration file.
- `tsconfig.json`: The TypeScript configuration file.

### Basic example

Here's an example of a basic Python service:

```ts
import { defineService } from "@getcronit/python";

export default defineService({
  Query: {
    sum: (a: number, b: number) => a + b,
  },
  Mutation: {
    divide: (a: number, b: number) => a / b,
  },
});
```

## Secure the API

### Add ZITADEL info to the service

1. Create a `.env` file in the root folder of your project and add the following configuration:

```bash
AUTH_ISSUER='URL to the zitadel instance'
AUTH_PROJECT_ID='ID of the project'
```

It should look something like this:

```bash
AUTH_ISSUER='https://example.zitadel.cloud'
AUTH_PROJECT_ID='250719519163548112'
```

2. Copy the `.json`-key-file that you downloaded from the ZITADEL Console into the root folder of your project and rename it to `key.json`.

### Auth

Python provides a auth module and a decorator to check the validity of the token and the permissions.

- `auth.initialize()`: Initializes the authentication middleware.
- `auth.require()` : Middleware to check if the token is valid.
- `auth.require({roles: ['role']})`: Middleware to check if the token is valid and has the specified roles.
- `requireAuth()`: Decorator to check if the token is valid.
- `requireAuth({roles: ['role']})`: Decorator to check if the token is valid and has the specified roles.

### Build the Python service

Now we will create a new Python service with the following endpoints:

- `/api/public`: Public endpoint
- `/api/private`: Private endpoint
- `/api/private-scoped`: Private endpoint with specific role
- `/graphql`: GraphQL endpoint
  - Query: `me`: Private endpoint that returns the current user and the messages if the role is `read:messages`
  - Query: `info`: Public endpoint

### Create the service

The following code demonstrates how to create a Python service with the required endpoints, it must be added to the `src/index.ts` file of your project:

```ts
import {
  defineService,
  PythonAPI,
  auth,
  requireAuth,
  getContext,
  ServiceError,
} from "@getcronit/python";

class User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  #messages: string[];

  constructor(id: string, name: string, messages: string[]) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.#messages = messages;
  }

  @requireAuth({ roles: ["read:messages"] })
  async messages() {
    return this.#messages;
  }

  static users: User[] = [];

  @requireAuth()
  static async me() {
    const ctx = getContext();
    const id = ctx.get("auth")!.sub;

    const user = User.users.find((user) => user.id === id);

    if (!user) {
      throw new ServiceError("User not found", {
        statusCode: 404,
        code: "USER_NOT_FOUND",
      });
    }

    return user;
  }

  @requireAuth()
  static async create() {
    const ctx = getContext();

    const auth = ctx.get("auth")!;

    // Check if the user already exists

    if (User.users.find((user) => user.id === auth.sub)) {
      throw new ServiceError("User already exists", {
        statusCode: 400,
        code: "USER_ALREADY_EXISTS",
      });
    }

    const user = new User(auth.sub, auth.username || "unknown", [
      "Welcome to Python with ZITADEL!",
    ]);

    User.users.push(user);

    return user;
  }
}

export default defineService({
  Query: {
    me: User.me,
    info: () => "Public Data",
  },
  Mutation: {
    createUser: User.create,
  },
});

export const configureApp: PythonAPI["configureApp"] = (app) => {
  // Initialize the authentication middleware
  app.use("*", auth.initialize());

  // Automatically try to create a user for each request for demonstration purposes
  app.use(async (_, next) => {
    try {
      await User.create();
    } catch {
      // Ignore errors
      // Fail silently if the user already exists
    }

    await next();
  });

  app.get("/api/info", (c) => {
    return new Response("Public Data");
  });

  // The `auth.require()` middleware is optional here, as the `User.me` method already checks for it.
  app.get("/api/me", auth.require(), async (c) => {
    const user = await User.me();

    return c.json(user);
  });

  // A role check for `read:messages` is not required here, as the `user.messages` method already checks for it.
  app.get("/api/me/messages", auth.require(), async (c) => {
    const user = await User.me();

    // This will throw an error if the user does not have the `read:messages` role
    return c.json(await user.messages());
  });
};
```

### Call the API

To call the API you need an access token, which is then verified by ZITADEL.
Please follow [this guide here](/docs/guides/integrate/token-introspection/private-key-jwt#get-an-access-token), ignoring the first step as we already have the `.json`-key-file from the serviceaccount.

:::info
You can also create a PAT for the serviceuser and use it to test the API. For this, follow [this guide](/docs/guides/integrate/service-users/personal-access-token#create-a-service-user-with-a-pat).
:::

Optionally set the token as an environment variable:

```
export TOKEN='MtjHodGy4zxKylDOhg6kW90WeEQs2q...'
```

Now you have to start the Python service:

```bash
bun run develop
```

With the access token, you can then do the following calls:

1. GraphQL:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -G http://localhost:3000/graphql --data-urlencode 'query={ info }'
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -G http://localhost:3000/graphql --data-urlencode 'query={ me { id name } }'
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -G http://localhost:3000/graphql --data-urlencode 'query={ me { id name messages } }'

```

You can also visit the GraphQL playground at `http://localhost:3000/graphql` and execute the queries there.

2. Routes:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/info
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/me
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/me/messages
```
