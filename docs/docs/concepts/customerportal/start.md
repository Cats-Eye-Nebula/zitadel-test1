Got to [ZITADEL Customer Portal](https://zitadel.cloud) and enter all the detail information.
As soon as you click "Let's go" you will get two initialization mails to finish your registration.
One is for your Customer Portal account and the other for your new created ZITADEL instance, verify both to be able to login to the systems.

The instance you have created will automatically be in the free subscription, which already allows you to use all the features.
