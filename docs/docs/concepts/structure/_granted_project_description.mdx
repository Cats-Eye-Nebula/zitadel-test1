![Organization Grant](/img/concepts/objects/organization_grants.png)

With ZITADEL you can grant selected roles within your project to an organization.
The receiving organization can then create authorizations for their users on their own (self-service).

An example could be a service provider that offers a SaaS solution that has different permissions for employees working in Sales and Accounting.
As soon as a new client purchases the service, the provider could grant the roles `sales` and `accounting` to that organization,
allowing them to self-manage how they want to allocate roles to their users.

The process of assigning certain roles by default or according to rules can be further automated by using Service Users in the service provider’s business process.

Your organization can grant and receive projects.
After you grant, the receiving organization is displayed in the section GRANTED ORGANIZATIONS of your project.

A granted project, on the other hand, belongs to a third party, granting you some rights to manage certain roles of their project.
To clearly separate granted projects from your organization’s projects,
ZITADEL Console shows granted projects in a dedicated navigation menu.

Note that you can also grant selected roles of a project to an individual user, instead of an organization.
We discuss this in more detail in a later section.
