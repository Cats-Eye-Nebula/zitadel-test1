![Organization Grant](/img/concepts/objects/organization_grants.png)

With ZITADEL you can grant selected roles within your project to an organization.
The receiving organization can then create authorizations for their users on their own (self-service).

An example could be a service provider that offers a SaaS solution that has different permissions for employees working in Sales and Accounting.
As soon as a new client purchases the service, the provider could grant the roles `sales` and `accounting` to that organization,
allowing them to self-manage how they want to allocate roles to their users.

The process of assigning certain roles by default or according to rules can be further automated by utilizing Service Users in the service provider’s business process.

Obviously, your organization can grant projects and receive projects.
When you are granting, then the receiving organization will be displayed in the section GRANTED ORGANIZATIONS of your project.

A granted project, on the other hand, belongs to a third party, granting you some rights to manage certain roles of their project.
ZITADEL Console shows granted projects in a dedicated navigation menu, to clearly separate from your organization’s projects.

Please note that you can also grant selected roles of a project to an individual user, instead of an organization.
We will discuss this in more detail in a later section.
