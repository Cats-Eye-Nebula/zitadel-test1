title: Settings/Policies
---

Settings and policies are configurations of all the different parts of the Instance or an organization. For all parts we have a suitable default in the Instance.
The default configuration can be overridden for each organization, some policies are currently only available on the instance level. If thats the case it will be mentioned on the descriptions below.

You can find these settings in the instance page under settings, or on a specific organization menu organization in the section policies.
Each policy can be overridden and reset to the default.

## General

:::info
Only available on the instance settings
:::

At the moment general settings is only one configuration. This defines the default language of the whole instance.
