title: Settings/Policies
---

Settings and policies are configurations of all the different parts of the Instance or an organization. For all parts we have a suitable default in the Instance.
The default configuration can be overridden for each organization, some policies are currently only available on the instance level.

API wise, settings are often called policies.
