Projects are a vessel for all organization components that closely relate to one another.
Multiple projects can exist within an organization.

All applications within a project share the same roles, grants, and authorizations:

* **Applications** is your software that initiates the authorization flow. This could be a web app and a mobile app that share the same roles.
* **Roles** let you manage user-access rights for a project.
* **Authorizations** define which users have which roles. Authorizations are also called __user grants_.
* **Granted Organizations** can manage selected roles for your project on their own.
