ZITADEL takes the following approach to organizations:

* Multiple organizations share the same system. In this case multiple organizations share the same service, zitadel.ch.
* Organizations can grant each other rights to self-manage certain aspects of the IAM (eg, roles for access management).
* Organizations are vessels for users and projects.

Organizations in ZITADEL are therefore comparable to tenants of a system, or to organizational units of a directory-based system.

Within your organization, you can use projects to manage the security context of closely related components, such as roles, grants and authorizations for multiple clients. You can set up multiple projects within your organization.

ZITADEL allows you to give other organizations permission to manage certain aspects of a project within your organization. This means you could set up a project with roles that should exist within your service/software, but allow another organization to allocate the roles to users within their own organization. As a service provider, you will find this feature useful, as it allows you to establish a self-service culture for your business customers.

Each organization has its own pool of usernames for its domain (`{username}@{domainname}.{zitadeldomain}`).
This naming structure applies to both human and service users.
A username is unique within your organization
You can configure ZITADEL to use your own domain (`{loginname}@{yourdomain.tld}`).
This simplifies the login experience for your users.
