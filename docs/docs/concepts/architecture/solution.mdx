## High availability

ZITADEL can be run as high available system with ease. 
Since the storage layer takes the heavy lifting of making sure that data in synched across, server, data centers or regions.

Depending on your projects needs our general recommendation is to run ZITADEL and ZITADELs storage layer across multiple availability zones in the same region or if you need higher guarantees run the storage layer across multiple regions.
Consult the [CockroachDB documentation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/) for more details or use the [CockroachCloud Service](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/create-an-account.html)

> Soon ZITADEL will also support Postgres as database.

## Scaleability

ZITADEL can be scaled in a linear fashion in multiple dimensions.

- Vertical on your compute infrastructure
- Horizontal in a region
- Horizontal in multiple regions

Our customers can reuse the same already known binary or container and scale it across multiple server, datacenter and regions.
To distribut traffic an already existing proxy infrastructure can be reused. 
Simply steer traffic by path, hostname, IP address or any other metadata to the ZITADEL of your choice.

> To improve your service quality we recommend steering traffic by path to different ZITADEL deployments

## Example Deployment Architecture

### Single Cluster / Region

A ZITADEL Cluster is a highly available IAM system with each component critical for serving traffic laid out at least three times.
As our storage layer (CockroachDB) relies on Raft, it is recommended to operate odd numbers of storage nodes to prevent "split brain" problems.
Hence our reference design for Kubernetes is to have three application nodes and three storage nodes.

> If you are using a serverless offering like Google Cloud Run you can scale ZTIADEL from 0 to 1000 Pods without the need of deploying the node across multiple availability zones.

### Multi Cluster / Region

To scale ZITADEL across regions it is recommend to create at least three cluster.
We recommend to run an odd number of storage clusters (storage nodes per data center) to compensate for "split brain" scenarios.
In our reference design we recommend to create one cluster per region or cloud provider with a minimum of three regions.

With this design even the outage of a whole data-center would have a minimal impact as all data is still available at the other two locations.
