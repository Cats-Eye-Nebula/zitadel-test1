### SDK

Java Spring Security is a widely used and common framework to integrate Authentication and Authorization into your Applications.
As of this at the moment there is no specific ZITADEL SDK, but we do show you how to integrate ZITADEL with Java Spring Security.
You can use this for both your Frontend as for your API Applications.

The following features are covered by Java Spring Security:
- Authenticate your user using OIDC
- Requesting ZITADEL userinfo endpoint to get user data
- Refresh Token
- Requesting User Roles from userinfo
- Check if user has specified role
- Logout

The goal is to extend the SDK over the time with the following features:
- Integrate ZITADEL APIs to read and manage resources
- Build your own login UI using our Session API

### Example Application

The [zitadel-vue](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-vue) repository also includes an Example Application ready to start and show how a Vue application looks like with integrated ZITADEL Login.

### Step-By-Step Guide

The [Step-By-Step Guide](/docs/examples/login/vue) leads you through the whole process from configuring the right application in ZITADEL to a ready application with integrated Login.
