- [Dart Client Library for ZITADEL](https://github.com/smartive/zitadel-dart)

### SDK

ZITADEL doesn't provide a Flutter SDK to build the login part of your app.
We recommend using a OIDC Library such as [package:oidc](https://pub.dev/packages/oidc).

Check out our [Example Application](/docs/sdk-examples/flutter#example-application)

:::note
For a ZITADEL Dart client library which includes the complied and generated gRPC service clients for the ZITADEL API check out: [smartive/zitadel-dart](https://github.com/smartive/zitadel-dart)

This library is built by our community.

### Example Application

The [zitadel-vue](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-vue) repository also includes an Example Application ready to start and show how a Vue application looks like with integrated ZITADEL Login.

What does the Example include:
- Home Page with Login Button
- Authenticating user with OIDC PKCE Flow
- Private Page: Only accessible after login

### Step-By-Step Guide

The [Step-By-Step Guide](/docs/examples/login/flutter) leads you through the whole process from configuring the right application in ZITADEL to a ready application with integrated Login.

After completing the Step-By-Step Guide you will have:
1. Example Mobile App with integrated ZITADEL Login
2. Example page accessible by authenticated user
3. Correct setup for your application in ZITADEL
