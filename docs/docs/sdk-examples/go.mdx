### Step-By-Step Guide

For Go we do have two different Step-By-Step Guides.
One to create your web application with integrated login and one to create your API with permission checks for calling users.
The guides lead you through the whole process from configuring the right application in ZITADEL to a ready application with integrated login or authentication checks.

#### Web Application Guide

After completing the Step-By-Step Guide you will have:
1. Example Web Application with integrated ZITADEL Login
2. Example page accessible by authenticated user showing retrieved user information
4. Logout
5. Correct setup for your application in ZITADEL
