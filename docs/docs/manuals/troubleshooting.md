## User Agent does not correspond

This error appeared for some users as soon as they were redirected to the login
page of ZITADEL. ZITADEL uses some cookies to identify the browser/user agent of
the user, so it is able to store the active user sessions. By blocking the
cookies the functions of ZITADEL will be affected.

We only found this issue with iPhone users, and it was dependent on the settings
of the device.

### Solution

Go to the settings of the app Safari and check in the "Experimental WebKit
Features" if SameSite strict enforcement (ITP) is disabled Also check if "block
all cookies" is active. If so please disable this setting.

To make sure, that your new settings will trigger, please restart your mobile
phone and try it again.

**Settings > Safari > Advanced > Experimental Features > disable: „SameSite
strict enforcement (ITP)“**

**Settings > Safari > disable: "Block All cookies"**
