title: ZITADEL Managers
---


ZITADEL Managers are Users who have permission to manage ZITADEL itself. There are some different levels for managers.

- **IAM Managers**: This is the highest level. Users with IAM Manager roles are able to manage the whole IAM.
- **Org Managers**: Managers in the Organisation Level are able to manage everything within the granted Organisation.
- **Project Mangers**: In this level the user is able to manage a project.
- **Project Grant Manager**: The project grant manager is for projects, which are granted of another organisation.

To configure managers in ZITADEL go to the resource where you like to add it (e.g IAM, Organisation, Project, GrantedProject).
In the right part of the console you can finde **MANAGERS** in the details part. Here you have a list of the current managers and can add a new one.
