## General

### Introduction

CAOS Ltd. (**&quot;we&quot;**) offers &quot;Identity and Access Management as service&quot; with the brand name "ZITADEL Cloud Services" (**Services**).

The customer relationship (**&quot;Framework Agreement&quot;**) is created by the **Customer** (**&quot;you&quot;**) by creating a user or organisation within the ZITADEL Cloud Service. On the basis of this framework agreement you may then choose to make use of payable services as you wish (&quot;self service&quot;), i.e. you may book services, options and packages yourself at any time (&quot;booking&quot;) and subsequently terminate them.  
The terms of service (**"TOS"**) outlined in this document establish the most important points of this framework agreement â€“ independently of the use of any services.

### Alterations

Any provisions which deviate from these TOS must be agreed in writing between the Customer and us. Such agreements shall take precedence over the TOS outlined in this document.

### Transfer

You may only transfer the Framework Agreement or Services used in the context of the Framework Agreement to third parties with our prior written consent.

## Our Services

### Type and scope of the services

We provide the Services under the conditions stated on our websites at the time of booking.

### Modifications of services offered

We are entitled to offer new services, to withdraw existing services (&quot;termination&quot;) or to modify the specifications and prices of existing services (&quot;modification&quot;) at any time. If the modification or termination affects a service that you are using at that time, we will inform you via email that said service will be automatically modified and/or is no longer available after a period of 30 days.

### Modification of services booked by you

You may change or terminate Services booked by you at any time. You may, where applicable, add more Services (e.g. add-ons) to your existing Services at any time.

### Due care

We take all appropriate physical and electronic precautions to ensure the security and availability of our infrastructure and the service offered thereupon, in particular to protect against unauthorized access to data, data loss, failures and misuse.

See [Annex](data-processing-agreement#annex-regarding-security-measures) to our data processing agreement for more information.

### Limited influence

Be advised that the scope of our influence is limited. For example, the actual accessibility of a service is also dependent on the connection to and between various Internet Service Providers (&quot;ISPs&quot;). Portions of our services, i.e. software components, may also be beyond our influence and be subject to their own contractual conditions. You accept that in such cases we reject any responsibility.

### Service level

We guarantee no minimal availability of our Services. However by purchasing a service tier you might be eligible for a SLA, please consult the pricing page for details. During previously announced maintenance work and in cases of force majeure the services shall be considered fully available for the aforementioned calculation.

If the guaranteed level of availability is not achieved due to failures, you may demand a pro-rata credit note for the duration of said failures for the services you use that have been affected. Such a credit note must be requested in writing within 10 days of the end of the quarter, may only be used to book services in the future and will in no case be paid as a cash equivalent. No further guarantees are provided.

### Inclusion of third parties

We may include third parties in the provision of our services, which may in turn require you to accept additional conditions (i.e. for payment processing).

## Your obligations

### Contact information

At our request you will provide your truthful contact information and keep it updated at all times. You must also ensure that you actually receive messages, in particular emails, intended for you.

### Use

You will ensure that the use of your services by yourself or third parties complies with all applicable legislation and these TOS at all times. You are expressly forbidden from using our services for phishing and social engineering.

### Fair use

The &quot;fair use&quot; principle applies to the use of our services. We optimize our infrastructure in such a way that sufficient capacity is available to you even during short-term increased demand (&quot;peaks&quot;). You are nonetheless required to adhere to reasonable use of our resources in order to avoid negatively affecting the services for other customers.

### Security

You will take appropriate measures to prevent any misuse of the services you booked. These include, for example, securing the software used and the prompt installation of security updates as well as using suitably secure passwords.

### Disaster recovery

We take care of the necessary disaster recovery measures. The goal is to maintain a maximum 24h old restore point off all the vital data.

Any liability for damages, indirect or direct, in case of data loss is explicitly rejected.

### Reporting obligations

You will immediately report any knowledge of a misuse of your booked services.

### Cooperation

If the maintenance of service quality requires your cooperation, for example to remedy errors in the services you use, you will provide said cooperation promptly and free of charge.

### Third party obligations

You will ensure that your vicarious agents, customers and third parties fulfill these obligations as well.

## Financial

### Credit and payment

A payment account is required for the purchase of services. The costs for the services you have purchased will be debited periodically and in advance from your payment account.

### No reimbursement

Any remaining credit shall automatically expire upon termination of the framework agreement.

- Your credit has been used up by services and/or any applicable credit limit has been reached;
- You are in default in the payment of open invoices and/or prompt payment seems unlikely (i.e. in the event of insolvency proceedings);
- Your services were used illegally or in breach of contract, or if there is reasonable suspicion of such use (i.e. in the event of complaints or abuse reports);
- Other customers&#39; services are being negatively affected in breach of the fair use provision, including in the event of your services being subject to attacks by third parties (i.e. DoS/DDoS attacks);
- We consider the suspension or termination of the services to be necessary for the protection of ourselves, our infrastructure or other customers.

and/or as a result of events beyond our influence.
