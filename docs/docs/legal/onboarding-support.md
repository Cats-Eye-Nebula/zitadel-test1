This annex of the [Framework Agreement](terms-of-service) describes the onboarding support services offered by us for our Services.

Last revised: October 5, 2023

TODO: - Introduction: overview of how we would tackle the migration/introduction

## Proof of value

Within a short time-frame we can show the value of using our Services and have the ability to establish proof of working setup for your most critical use cases.
We may offer to support you during an initial period to evaluate next steps.
This period should be at most a few weeks where you will also commit to complete the proof of value.

If you intend to use the open source version exclusively then please join our community chat or Github.
Your questions might help other people in the community and will make our project better over time.

## Onboarding term

With the onboarding support we provide the initial knowledge transfer to configure and operate ZITADEL.
During the term you will get direct access to our engineering team via [Technical Account Management](./support-services.md#technical-account-manager).

Duration is typically 3 months but this could vary depending on your requirements.
