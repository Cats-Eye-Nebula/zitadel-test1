This annex of the [Framework Agreement](../terms-of-service) describes the services offered by us.

Last revised: October 31, 2023

## Data location

Data location refers to a region, consisting of one or many countries or territories, where the customer's data is being hosted.

We can not guarantee that during transit the data will only remain within this region. We take measures, as outlined in our [privacy policy](../policies/privacy-policy), to protect your data in transit and in rest.

The following regions will be available when using our cloud service. This list is for informational purposes and will be updated in due course, please refer to our website for all available regions at this time.

- **Global**: All available cloud regions offered by our cloud provider
- **Switzerland**: Exclusively on Swiss region
- **GDPR safe countries**: Exclusively [Adequate Countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) as recognized by the European Commission under the GDPR

## Backup

Our backup strategy executes daily full backups and differential backups on much higher frequency.
In a disaster recovery scenario, our goal is to guarantee a recovery point objective (RPO) of 1h, and a higher but similar recovery time objective (RTO).
Under normal operations, RPO and RTO goals are below 1 minute.

If you you have different requirements we provide you with a flexible approach to backup, restore, and transfer data (f.e. to a self-hosted setup) through our APIs.
Please consult the [migration guides](/docs/guides/migrate/introduction.md) for more information.
