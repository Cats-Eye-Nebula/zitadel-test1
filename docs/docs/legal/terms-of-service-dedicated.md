### Background

Within the scope of the Framework Agreement, the Customer may choose to purchase a subscription that requires a dedicated instance of ZITADEL. These additional terms for dedicated instance ("**Dedicated Cloud Terms**") apply in addition to the Framework Agreement.

### Service

CAOS operates and manages a **Dedicated Instance** of ZITADEL in a private infrastructure environment dedicated for Customer's use and provides support services for the customer according to the agreed terms and SLA.

Each Dedicated Instance consists, except agreed otherwise in writing, a multi-zonal high-availability configuration that guarantees loads up to the specified [rate limits](https://docs.zitadel.ch/docs/legal/rate-limit-policy#what-rate-limits-do-apply).

### Operations

CAOS will install and manage the Dedicated Cloud on virtual machines provided by CAOS through preferred infrastructure providers. Costs for infrastructure or cloud providers are not included in the Subscription, if not agreed otherwise in writing.

You may choose to provide the required infrastructure yourself. You must comply with the [requirements and prerequisites](https://docs.zitadel.ch/docs/guides/installation/managed-dedicated-instance) as documented.

You may not modify, maintain or attempt to modify the Dedicated Instance, except in with prior instructions by CAOS.

### Management

CAOS will use the same backup strategy as for ZITADEL Cloud (public cloud) services, except otherwise agreed between you and CAOS in writing.
