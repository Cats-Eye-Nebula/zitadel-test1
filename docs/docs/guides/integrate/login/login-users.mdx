## Using industry standard protocols

### Authenticate users with OpenID Connect 1.0

OpenID Connect (OIDC) offers a modern and lightweight authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0, providing flexible authentication flows and easy integration with web and mobile applications.
ZITADEL offers a certified compliant implementation of the OpenID Connect Standard, ensuring compliance with proven security best practices.

Authenticating users through the OpenID Connect protocol, typically requires an application to redirect the user with an [Auth Request](/docs/apis/openidoauth/authrequest) to the identity provider that contains information such as the requesting application, [scopes](/docs/apis/openidoauth/scopes), and redirect url.
The identity provider is not part of the original application, but a standalone service like ZITADEL that may run under the [same domain](/docs/concepts/features/custom-domain.md)
The user will authenticate using their credentials.
After successful authentication the user will be redirected back to the original application.

### Authenticate users with SAML

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is a widely adopted standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between identity providers and service providers.

Authentication with SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) involves a series of exchanges between a service provider (SP), an identity provider (IdP), and the user. Here's an overview of how the process typically works:

1. **User Attempts to Access a Service**: The user tries to access a service or application that requires authentication, such as logging into a web application.

2. **Service Provider Redirects to Identity Provider**: The service provider (SP) detects that the user needs to be authenticated and redirects the user's browser to the designated identity provider (IdP) for authentication. This redirection often occurs via a SAML request, which includes information about the service provider and a request for authentication.

3. **User Authenticates with Identity Provider**: The user is presented with the identity provider's login page, where they enter their credentials (username and password). Alternatively, depending on the IdP's configuration, the user might be authenticated using single sign-on (SSO) mechanisms such as a pre-existing session or multi-factor authentication.

4. **Identity Provider Generates SAML Assertion**: Upon successful authentication, the identity provider creates a SAML assertion containing information about the user, such as their identity and attributes. This assertion is digitally signed by the identity provider to ensure its integrity and authenticity.

5. **SAML Assertion Sent to Service Provider**: The identity provider sends the SAML assertion back to the user's browser as a response to the original SAML request. The browser then forwards the assertion to the service provider.

6. **Service Provider Validates SAML Assertion**: The service provider receives the SAML assertion and validates it to ensure its integrity and authenticity. This typically involves verifying the digital signature of the assertion and checking that it originated from a trusted identity provider.

7. **User Granted Access**: If the SAML assertion is successfully validated, the service provider considers the user authenticated and grants them access to the requested service or application. The user can now interact with the service without needing to reauthenticate until their session expires or they log out.

Overall, authentication with SAML provides a secure and standardized method for enabling single sign-on (SSO) and federated identity management across different applications and systems.
It allows users to access multiple services with a single set of credentials, streamlining the authentication process while maintaining strong security measures.

Note that SAML might not be suitable for mobile applications.
In case you want to integrate a mobile application, use OpenID Connect or our Session API.

## Use the Hosted Login to sign-in users

ZITADEL provides a hosted single-sign-on page to securely sign-in users to your applications. 
ZITADEL's hosted login page serves as a centralized authentication interface provided for applications that integrate ZITADEL.
As a developer, understanding the hosted login page is essential for seamlessly integrating authentication into your application.

### Centralized authentication endpoint

ZITADEL's hosted login page acts as a centralized authentication endpoint where users are redirected to authenticate themselves.
When users attempt to access a protected resource within your application, you can redirect them to the hosted login page to authenticate using their login methods and credentials or through Single-sign-on (SSO).
After successful authentication, the user will be redirected back to the originating application.

### Security and Compliance

ZITADEL's hosted login page prioritizes security and compliance with industry standards and regulations.
It employs best practices for securing authentication processes, such as encryption, token-based authentication, and adherence to protocols like OAuth 2.0, [OpenID Connect](/docs/guides/integrate/login/oidc), and [SAML](/docs/guides/integrate/login/saml).

We make sure to harden your login ui an minimize the attack surface.
One of the measures we apply is setting the necessary security heads thus minimizing the risk of common vulnerabilities in login pages, such as XSS vulnerabilities.
Put your current login to the test and compare the results with our hosted login page.
Tools like [Mozilla's Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/) can give you a good first impression your security posture.

### Developer-Friendly Integration

Integrating the hosted login page into your application is straightforward, thanks to ZITADEL's developer-friendly documentation, SDKs, and APIs. Developers can easily implement authentication flows, handle authentication callbacks, and customize the user experience to seamlessly integrate authentication with their application's workflow.

Overall, ZITADEL's hosted login page simplifies the authentication process for developers by providing a secure, customizable, and developer-friendly authentication interface. By leveraging this centralized authentication endpoint, developers can enhance their application's security, user experience, and compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Key features of the hosted login

### Flexible usernames

Different login name formats can be used on ZITADEL's hosted login page to select a user.
Login methods can be a user's username, containing the username and an [organization domain](/docs/guides/manage/console/organizations#domain-verification-and-primary-domain), their email addresses, or their phone numbers.
By default all of these login methods are allowed and can be adjusted by [Managers](/docs/concepts/structure/managers) to meet their requirements.

### Support for multiple authentication methods

The hosted login page supports various authentication methods, including traditional username/password authentication, social login options, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and passwordless authentication methods like [passkeys](/docs/concepts/features/passkeys.md).
Available second factor (2FA) and multi-factor authentication methods (MFA) include OTP via authenticator app, OTP via SMS, OTP via email, and U2F.

Developers can configure the authentication methods offered on the login page based on their application's security and usability requirements.

### Enterprise single-sign-on

![Screenshot of zitadel console showing different identity provider templates](/img/guides/integrate/login/login-external-idp-templates.png)

With the hosted login page from ZITADEL developers will get the best support for multi-tenancy single-sign-on with third party identity providers.
ZITADEL acts as [identity broker](/docs/concepts/features/identity-brokering) between your applications and different external identity providers, reducing the implementation effort for developers.
External Identity providers can be configured for the whole instance or for each organization which represents a group of users such as a B2B customer or organizational unit.

ZITADEL offers various [identity provider templates](/docs/guides/integrate/identity-providers) to integrate providers such as [Okta](/docs/guides/integrate/identity-providers/okta), [Entra ID](/docs/guides/integrate/identity-providers/azure-ad) or on-premise [LDAP](/docs/guides/integrate/identity-providers/ldap).

### Multi-tenancy authentication

ZITADEL simplifies multi-tenancy authentication by securely managing authentication for multiple tenants, called [Organizations](/docs/concepts/structure/organizations), within a single [instance](/docs/concepts/structure/instance).
Key features include:

1. **Secure Tenant Isolation**: Ensures robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access between tenants, maintaining data privacy and compliance. [Managers](/docs/concepts/structure/managers) for an organization have only access to data and configuration within their Organization.
2. **Custom Authentication Configurations**: Allows tailored [authentication settings](/docs/guides/manage/console/instance-settings#login-behavior-and-access), [branding](/docs/guides/manage/customize/branding), and policies for each tenant.
3. **Centralized Management**: Provides [centralized administration](/docs/guides/manage/console/managers) for efficient management across all tenants.
4. **Scalability and Flexibility**: Scales seamlessly to accommodate growing organizations of all sizes.
5. **Domain Discovery**: Starting on a central login page, route users to their tenant based on their email-address or other user attributes. Authentication settings will be applied automatically based on the organization's policies, this includes routing users seamlessly to third party identity providers like [Entra ID](/docs/guides/integrate/identity-providers/azure-ad)

### Customization Options

While the hosted login page provides a default authentication interface out-of-the-box, ZITADEL offers [customization options](/docs/guides/manage/customize/branding) to tailor the login page to match your application's branding and user experience requirements.
Developers can customize elements such as logos, colors, and messaging to ensure a seamless integration with their application's user interface.

:::info Customization and Branding
The login page can be changed by customizing different branding aspects and you can define a custom domain for the login (eg, login.acme.com).

By default, the displayed branding is defined [based on the user's domain](/docs/guides/solution-scenarios/domain-discovery). In case you want to show the branding of a specific organization by default, you need to either pass a primary domain scope (`urn:zitadel:iam:org:domain:primary:{domainname}`) with the authorization request, or define the behavior on your Project's settings.
:::

### Fast account switching

The hosted login page remembers users that have previously authenticated.
In case a user has used multiple accounts, for example a private account and a work account, to authenticate, then all accounts will be shown on the Account Picker.
Users can still login with a different user that is not in the list.
This allows users to quickly switch between users and provide a better user experience.

:::info
This behavior can be changed with the authorization request. Please refer to our [guide](/guides/integrate/login-users).
:::

### Self-service for users

ZITADEL's hosted login page offers [many self-service flows](/docs/concepts/features/selfservice) that allow users to setup authentication methods or recover their login information.
Developers use the self-service functionalities to reduce manual tasks and improve user experience.
Key features include:

### Password reset

Unauthenticated users can request a password reset after providing the loginname during the login flow.

- User selects reset password
- An email will be sent to the verified email address
- User opens a link and has to provide a new password

#### Prompt users to setup multifactor authentication

Users are automatically prompted to provide a second factor, when

- Instance or organization [login policy](/concepts/structure/policies#login-policy) is set
- Requested by the client
- A multi-factor is setup for the user

When a multi-factor is required, but not set-up, then the user is requested to set-up an additional factor.

:::info Disabling multifactor prompt
You can disable the prompt, in case multifactor authentication is not enforced by setting the [**Multifactor Init Lifetime**](/docs/guides/manage/console/instance-settings#login-lifetimes) to 0.
:::

#### Enroll passkeys

Users can select a button to initiate passwordless login or use a fall-back method (ie. login with username/password), if available.

The passwordless login flow follows the FIDO2 / WebAuthN standard.
Briefly explained the following happens:

- User selects button
- User's device will ask the user to provide a gesture (e.g., FaceID, Windows Hello, Fingerprint, PIN)
- The user is being redirected to the application

With the introduction of passkeys the gesture can be provided on ANY of the user's devices.
This is not strictly the device where the login flow is being executed (e.g., on a mobile device).
The user experience depends mainly on the used operating system and browser.
