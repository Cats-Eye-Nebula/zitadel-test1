ZITADEL is a comprehensive identity and access management platform designed to streamline user authentication, authorization, and management processes for your application. It offers a range of features, including single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and centralized user management.

With ZITADEL, you can securely authenticate users using industry-standard protocols such as OpenID Connect and SAML. This enables seamless integration with various applications and services, providing a unified authentication experience for your users.

Besides federated authentication with OpenID Connect and SAML, ZITADEL offers an API to authenticate users allowing you to create your own login process and user interface.

In this guide we will walk through the different protocols, features and concepts that can be used to login users securely into your applications.

## Using industry standard protocols

### Authenticate users with OpenID Connect 1.0

OpenID Connect (OIDC) offers a modern and lightweight authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0, providing flexible authentication flows and easy integration with web and mobile applications.
ZITADEL offers a certified compliant implementation of the OpenID Connect Standard, ensuring compliance with proven security best practices.

Authenticating users through the OpenID Connect protocol, typically requires an application to redirect the user with an [Auth Request](/docs/apis/openidoauth/authrequest) to the identity provider.
The identity provider is not part of the original application, but a standalone service like ZITADEL that may run under the [same domain](/docs/concepts/features/custom-domain.md)

### Authenticate users with SAML

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is a widely adopted standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between identity providers and service providers.

- enterprise applications
- often used in single-sign-on
- applications might need to get users before authentication
- not suitable for mobile apps

## Use ZITADEL Login to login users

ZITADEL provides a hosted login page to securely sign-in users to your applications.

- redirect to that login
- authenticate
- redirect back to the application
- "federation"

## Build a custom Login UI to authenticate users

## Single sign-on

Federated authentication also facilitates Single Sign-On (SSO), a crucial aspect of user authentication in modern applications.
Single Sign-On allows users to access multiple applications and services with just one set of credentials, eliminating the need to repeatedly enter login information.
With OpenID Connect and SAML, federated authentication becomes even more powerful, enabling seamless and secure access to resources across different identity providers and service providers.

By combining OpenID Connect and SAML, organizations can establish federated identity solutions that offer interoperability, scalability, and enhanced user experiences, ultimately improving security and productivity for both users and applications.
