To replace our current golang built login UI and showcase the use of our new resource, session and OIDC APIs, we've created the [Typescript Repository](https://github.com/zitadel/typescript).
The typescript repository contains all TypeScript and JavaScript packages and applications you need to create your own Login UI using the ZITADEL APIs.
The repo implements the [OIDC standard](./oidc-standard)

## Included Apps And Packages

- `login`: The future login UI used by ZITADEL Cloud, powered by Next.js
- `@zitadel/server`: core components for establishing node client connection, grpc stub
- `@zitadel/client`: core components for establishing web client connection, grpc stub
- `@zitadel/react`: shared React utilities and components built with Tailwind CSS
- `@zitadel/next`: shared Next.js utilities
- `@zitadel/tsconfig`: shared `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `eslint-config-zitadel`: ESLint preset

## How to setup domains

In order to use the new login app, the domain must be registered on your instance and use https.
If you are using a self hosted instance, [install](/docs/apis/resources/system/system-service-add-domain) your domain on your instance using the system service.

The login using our cloud service is still experimental, but you can purchase your domain on zitadel.com, install it on your domain following [our guide](/docs/guides/manage/cloud/instances#add-custom-domain).
After your domain has been verified, you can reconfigure your DNS settings in order to deploy the login on your own.
