The following pages describe the recommended training sessions for managing and supporting ZITADEL.

## ZITADEL Support Services Trainings

When entering a support services agreement with us, we recommend the following training sessions.

* [Operations training](supportservice/operations)
* [Application Support training](supportservice/application)
* [Recurring training](supportservice/recurring)

Additionally, you will benefit from sufficient time with a technical account manager in your support plan to clarify questions and get expert advice beyond solving support issues.

Training should be held as block-sessions with the relevant staff from your organization.
