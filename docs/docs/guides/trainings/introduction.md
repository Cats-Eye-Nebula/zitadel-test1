## ZITADEL Support Services Trainings

![Support Services Training](/img/training_support_services.png)

When entering a support services agreement with us, we recommend the following training sessions.

* [Operations training](supportservice/operations)
* [Application Support training](supportservice/application)
* [Recurring training](supportservice/recurring)

You will also benefit from spending time with a technical account manager in your support plan.
In this time, you can clarify questions you had and get expert advice beyond solving support issues.

Training should be held as block-sessions with the relevant staff from your organization.
