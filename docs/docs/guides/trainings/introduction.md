## ZITADEL Support Services Trainings

![Support Services Training](/img/training_support_services.png)

When entering into a support services agreement with us, we recommend the following trainings:

* [Operations training](supportservice/operations)
* [Application Support training](supportservice/application)
* [Recurring training](supportservice/recurring)

Additionally, you will benefit from sufficient time with a technical account manager in your support plan to clarify questions and get expert advice beyond solving support issues.

Training should be held as block-sessions with the relevant staff from your organization.
