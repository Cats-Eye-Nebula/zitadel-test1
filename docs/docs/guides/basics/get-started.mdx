*Authentication* is how an application can verify that its users are who they claim to be.
Most applications need authentication to securely store user data in the cloud and to provide the same personalized experience across all user devices.

ZITADEL's authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries.

It supports password authentication,
with two-factor authentication methods like One Time Password (OTP).
You easily integrate ZITADEL in your custom backend,
as it leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

### Verify your domain name (optional)

If you verify a domain, your organisation's users can use this domain as the **preferred logonname**.

### Elect Managers

ZITADEL allows you to give other users control over the ZITADEL Console itself.
You can restrict this access to `read` or `write`.
This is especially useful to granularly assign administration responsibilities to different users.
For example, you can permit managers to edit project settings, and permit others to only create users.
[The guides provide more information](../overview).

> Note: ZITADEL Managers are always located on the right sidepanel of the console.

### Integrating an application

After creating your project, you can start integrating your applications.

1. [Choose your project](https://console.zitadel.ch/projects).
1. Add a client by selecting **New** In the **APPLICATIONS** section on the top of the page.

The wizard provides some guidance what about client is right for you.
If you are still unsure, consult our [Guide Project](projects).
