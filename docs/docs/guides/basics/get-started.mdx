Most applications need to know the identity of a user allowing to securely store user data in the cloud and provide the same personalised experience across all of the user's devices.

ZITADEL's authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users in your application. It supports authentication using passwords and applies additional security with the help of a second factor, for example OTP, to ensure a safe and secure access.
It additionally leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect such that it can be easily integrated in your custom backend.

This provides a quick start guide on how to register your organization as well as creating your first project.

### Elect Managers

ZITADEL allows you to give other users control over ZITADEL Console itself. This can be restricted to some kind of write and/or read. This can be especially useful for directing administration over several users. You can have managers able to edit project settings and others able to create/add users only.
Read the [guides](../overview) for more information.

> Note: ZITADEL Managers are always located on the right sidepanel of console.
