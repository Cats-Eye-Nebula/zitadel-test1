## What is an instance?

import InstanceDescription from '../../concepts/structure/_instance_description.mdx';
import Column from '../../../src/components/column';

<InstanceDescription name="InstanceDescription" />

## Exercise - Create a new instance

The creation and management of an instance takes place in the Customer Portal.
To manage your existing instances you need login with your Customer Portal user. Be aware that this is not the same user as in the instance itself.

## Exercise - Add a custom domain

1. Browse to your instance
2. Click **Add custom domain**
3. To start the domain verification click the domain name and a dialog will appear, where you can choose between DNS or HTTP challenge methods.
4. For example, create a TXT record with your DNS provider for the used domain and click verify. ZITADEL will then proceed an check your DNS.
5. When the verification is successful you have the option to activate the domain by clicking **Set as primary**

> **_Please note:_** Do not delete the verification code, as ZITADEL Customer Portal will re-check the ownership of your domain from time to time

## Exercise - Change default settings of the instance

Redirect to your instance and login with your generated user ???
Go to the settings with the button at the top right of the header.
You will find all different kind of default settings here.
From password policy, to branding to texts of the login ui.
