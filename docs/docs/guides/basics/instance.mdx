## What is an instance?

import InstanceDescription from '../../concepts/structure/_instance_description.mdx';
import Column from '../../../src/components/column';

<InstanceDescription name="InstanceDescription" />

## Exercise - Create a new instance

:::note
This takes place in the [ZITADEL Cloud Customer Portal](https://zitadel.cloud)
:::

The creation and management of an instance takes place in the Customer Portal.
To manage your existing instances you need login with your Customer Portal user. Be aware that this is not the same user as in the instance itself.

## Login to your instance

:::note
This takes place in the your ZITADEL Cloud Instances Console
:::

After you have initialized your first admin user of the newly created ZITADEL instance. You can access the instance's Console, to manage all of your resources.
To login with the user you have initialized. You will find the link to access your instance in the initialization email of your user or in the detail page of your instance in the [ZITADEL Cloud](https://zitadel.cloud).

We generated a unique domain for each ZITADEL Cloud Instance that looks like this: {InstanceName}-{RandomString}.zitadel.cloud

### Elect New Managers

:::note
This part happens in the ZITADEL Console
:::

ZITADEL allows you to give other users control over ZITADEL Console itself. This can be restricted to some kind of write and/or read. This can be especially useful for directing administration over several users. You can have managers able to edit project settings and others able to create/add users only.
Read the [guides](../overview) for more information.

> Note: ZITADEL Managers are always located on the right sidepanel of console.

### Integrating an application

:::note
This part happens in the ZITADEL Console
:::

After creating your project you can start integrating your applications.
After choosing your project add a client application on the top of the page.
The wizard should provide some guidance what client is the proper for you. If you are still unsure consult our [Guide Project](projects).

## Update Billing Information

:::note
This part happens in the [ZITADEL Customer Portal](https://zitadel.cloud)
:::

You will only need to add billing information when your instance is in the paid tier. There are two options how to add your billing infos.
1. Go to the billing menu and add a new method. You will be able to choose the added method, when upgrading the instance to a paid tier.
2. Add the billing information directly in the upgrade process.

### Upgrade Instance

:::note
This part happens in the [ZITADEL Cloud Customer Portal](https://zitadel.cloud)
:::

import UpgradeInstanceDescription from '../../manuals/customerportal/_upgrade_instance_description.mdx';

<UpgradeInstanceDescription name="UpgradeInstanceDescription" />


## Exercise - Add a custom domain

1. Browse to your instance
2. Click **Add custom domain**
3. To start the domain verification click the domain name and a dialog will appear, where you can choose between DNS or HTTP challenge methods.
4. For example, create a TXT record with your DNS provider for the used domain and click verify. ZITADEL will then proceed an check your DNS.
5. When the verification is successful you have the option to activate the domain by clicking **Set as primary**

![Verify Domain](/img/console_verify_domain.gif)

> **_Please note:_** Do not delete the verification code, as ZITADEL Customer Portal will re-check the ownership of your domain from time to time

## Exercise - Change default settings of the instance

Redirect to your instance and login with your generated user ???
Go to the settings with the button at the top right of the header.
You will find all different kind of default settings here.
From password policy, to branding to texts of the login ui.

For this case we will change the branding.
Choose modify on the setting "branding".
You can switch between the light and the dark mode. Upload your logo and define the colors you like to have.
Make sure to click the button "apply configuration" after you are finish to trigger your settings.
