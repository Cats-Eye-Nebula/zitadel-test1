## What is an organization?

import OrgDescription from '../../concepts/structure/_org_description.mdx';
import Column from '../../../src/components/column';

<OrgDescription name="OrgDescription" />

First, let’s create a new organization and verify your domain name.
Afterwards, you can learn more in several other documentation modules, which detail how to manage organizations, projects, clients, and users.

## Exercise - Create a new organization

To register your organization and create a user for ZITADEL, visit zitadel.ch or go directly to <https://accounts.zitadel.ch/register/org> and fill in the required information.

![Register new Organization](/img/console_org_register.png)

<Column>
<div>
  If you already have an existing login for zitadel.ch, you need to visit the console.
  Then select your organization’s name in the upper-left corner, and **New organization**.
</div>

</Column>

## How ZITADEL handles usernames

As mentioned, each organization has its own pool of usernames.
These usernames include both humans and services.

For example, the username `road.runner` can exist only once and only for one user in an organization called ACME.
ZITADEL will automatically generate a *loginname* for each user, in the structure `{username}@{domainname}.{zitadeldomain}`.
In this example, the *loginname* would be `road.runner@acme.zitadel.ch`.

When you verify your domain name, ZITADEL generates additional loginnames for each user with the verified domain.
If ACME owned the domain acme.ch and verified this domain for the organization ACME, then the resulting loginname in our example would be `road.runner@acme.ch`.
This name would be in addition to the already generated `road.runner@acme.zitadel.ch`.
The user can now use either loginname to authenticate with your application.

## Domain verification and primary domain

After you successfully register your organization, ZITADEL automatically generates a domain name for your organization (eg, acme.zitadel.ch).
When you create users with your organization, their loginnames will have this suffix.

It's a good idea to use a domain name that you own for your loginname suffix.
This lets your users log in with their own company domain, improving user experience.
You can prove the ownership of your domain by DNS or HTTP challenge ([Lets Encrypt has documentation about the different "challenge" types](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/)).

An organization can have multiple domain names, but only one domain can be primary.
The primary domain defines which loginname ZITADEL displays to the user, and what information gets asserted in `access_tokens` (`preferred_username`).

Note that for users, who might already have colliding loginnames in the global organization, these loginnames' domains are replaced by a random value on domain verification.
(i.e. users who do not belong to a specific organization).
In the example with `acme.ch`, if a user ‘coyote’ exists in the global organization with the loginname `coyote@acme.ch`,
after ZITADEL verifies `acme.ch`, it will replace this loginname with `coyote@{randomvalue.tld}`.
ZITADEL will notify users affected by this change.

## Exercise - Verify your domain name

1. Browse to your organization.
2. Click **Add Domain**.
3. To start the domain verification, click the domain name. A dialog appears, where you can choose between DNS or HTTP challenge methods.
4. As an example, create a TXT record with your DNS provider for the used domain. Select **verify**.
   ZITADEL then checks your DNS.
5. After successful verification, you can activate the domain by clicking **Set as primary**

> **_Note:_** Do not delete the verification code, as ZITADEL will re-check the ownership of your domain from time to time

## Knowledge Check

* Users exist only within projects or clients
    - [ ] yes
    - [ ] no
* User can only login with `{username}@{domainname}.{zitadeldomain}`
    - [ ] yes
    - [ ] no
* You can delegate access management self-service to another organization
    - [ ] yes
    - [ ] no

<details>
    <summary>
        Solutions
    </summary>

* Users exist only within projects or clients
    - [ ] yes
    - [x] no (users exist within organizations)
* User can only login with `{username}@{domainname}.{zitadeldomain}`
    - [ ] yes
    - [x] no (You can validate your own domain and login with `{loginname}@{yourdomain.tld}`)
* You can delegate access management self-service to another organization
    - [x] yes
    - [ ] no

</details>

## Summary

* Create your organization and a new user by visiting zitadel.ch.
* Organizations are the top-most vessel for your IAM objects, such as users or projects.
* Verify your domain in the console to improve user experience; remember to store the verification code to allow recheck of ownership.
* You can delegate certain aspects of your IAM to other organizations for self-service.

Where to go from here:

* Create a project
* Setup passwordless *MFA*
* Manage ZITADEL roles
* Grant roles to other organizations or users
