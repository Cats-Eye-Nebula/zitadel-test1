## Token request

Next you will have to exchange the given `code` for the tokens. For this HTTP POST request (form-urlencoded) you will need to provide the following:

- code: the code that was issued from the authorization request
- grant_type: must be `authorization_code`
- redirect_uri: callback uri where the code was sent to. Must match exactly the redirect_uri of the authorization request

Depending on your authentication method you'll need additional headers and parameters:

Send your `client_id` and `client_secret` as Basic Auth Header. Note that OAuth2 requires client_id and client_secret to be form url encoded.
So check [Client Secret Basic Auth Method](../../apis/openidoauth/authn-methods#client-secret-basic) on how to build it correctly.

```curl
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/token \
--header 'Authorization: Basic ${basic}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data grant_type=authorization_code \
--data code=${code} \
--data redirect_uri=${redirect_uri}
```
