## Token request

Next you will have to exchange the given `code` for the tokens. For this HTTP POST request (form-urlencoded) you will need to provide the following:

- code: the code that was issued from the authorization request
- grant_type: must be `authorization_code`
- redirect_uri: callback uri where the code was sent to. Must match exactly the redirect_uri of the authorization request

Depending on your authentication method you'll need additional headers and parameters:

Send a JWT in the `client_assertion` and set the `client_assertion_type` to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`
for us to validate the signature against the registered public key:

```curl
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/token \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data grant_type=authorization_code \
--data code=${code} \
--data redirect_uri=${redirect_uri} \
--data client_assertion=${client_assertion} \
--data client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer
```
