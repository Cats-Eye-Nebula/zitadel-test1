## Callback

Regardless of a successful or error response from the authorization_endpoint, the authorization server will call your
callback endpoint you provided by the `redirect_uri`.

:::note
If the redirect_uri is not provided, was not registered or anything other prevents the auth server form returning the response to the client,
the error will be display directly to the user on the auth server.
:::

Upon successful authentication you'll be given a `code` and if provided the unmodified `state` parameter.
You will need this `code` in the token request.

If a parameter was missing, malformed or any other error occurred, your answer will contain an `error` stating the error type,
possibly an `error_description` providing some information about the error and its reason and the `state` parameter.
Check the [error response section](../../apis/openidoauth/endpoints#error-response) in the authorization_endpoint reference.
