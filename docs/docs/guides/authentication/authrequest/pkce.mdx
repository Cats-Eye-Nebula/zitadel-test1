## Auth Request

To initialize the user authentication, you will have to create an authorization request using HTTP GET in the user agent (browser)
on /authorize with at least the following parameters:

- `client_id`: this tells the authorization server which application it is, copy from Console
- `redirect_uri`: where the authorization code is sent to after the user authentication, must be one of the registered in the previous step
- `response_type`: if you want to have a code (authorization code flow) or directly a token (implicit flow), so when ever possible use `code`
- `scope`: what scope you want to grant to the access_token / id_token, minimum is `openid`, if you're unsure what you need you might start with `openid profile email`

We recommend always using two additional parameters `state` and `nonce`. The former enables you to transfer a state through
the authentication process. The latter is used to bind the client session with the id_token and to mitigate replay attacks.

PKCE stands for Proof Key for Code Exchange. So other than "normal" code exchange, the does not authenticate using
client_id and client_secret but an additional code. You will have to generate a random string, hash it and send this hash
on the authorization_endpoint. On the token_endpoint you will then send the plain string for the authorization to compute
the hash as well and to verify it's correct. In order to do so you're required to send the following two parameters as well:

- `code_challenge`: the base64url representation of the (sha256) hash of your random string
- `code_challenge_method`: must always be `S256` standing for sha256, this is the only algorithm we support

For example for `random-string` the code_challenge would be `9az09PjcfuENS7oDK7jUd2xAWRb-B3N7Sr3kDoWECOY`

The request would finally look like (linebreaks and whitespace for display reasons):

```curl
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://accounts.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/authorize
    ?client_id=${client_id}
    &redirect_uri=${redirect_uri}
    &response_type=code
    &scope=openid%20email%20profile
    &code_challenge=${code_challenge}
    &code_challenge_method=S256'
```

### Additional parameters and customization

There are additional parameters and values you can provide to satisfy your use case and to customize the user's authentication flow.
Please check the [authorization_endpoint reference](../../apis/openidoauth/endpoints#authorization_endpoint) in the OAuth / OIDC documentation.
