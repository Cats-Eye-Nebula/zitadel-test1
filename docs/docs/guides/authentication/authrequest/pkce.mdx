PKCE stands for Proof Key for Code Exchange. So other than "normal" code exchange, the does not authenticate using
client_id and client_secret but an additional code. You will have to generate a random string, hash it and send this hash
on the authorization_endpoint. On the token_endpoint you will then send the plain string for the authorization to compute
the hash as well and to verify it's correct. In order to do so you're required to send the following two parameters as well:

- `code_challenge`: the base64url representation of the (sha256) hash of your random string
- `code_challenge_method`: must always be `S256` standing for sha256, this is the only algorithm we support

For example for `random-string` the code_challenge would be `9az09PjcfuENS7oDK7jUd2xAWRb-B3N7Sr3kDoWECOY`

The request would finally look like (linebreaks and whitespace for display reasons):

```curl
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://accounts.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/authorize
    ?client_id=${client_id}
    &redirect_uri=${redirect_uri}
    &response_type=code
    &scope=openid%20email%20profile
    &code_challenge=${code_challenge}
    &code_challenge_method=S256'
```
