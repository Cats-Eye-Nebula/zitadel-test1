#### redirect_uri

Native clients might have to register multiple redirect_uris as operating system have different requirements.
Typically, you register a redirect_uri starting with a custom protocol, e.g. `ch.zitadel.app://callback`.
You're also allowed to use http://localhost, http://127.0.0.1 and http:[::1] without specifying a port: `http://locahost/callback`.

#### post creation actions

After the application creation, you might want to set additional options like `refresh_token` and `additional origins`.

If you want to request refresh_tokens and use them to renew the user's access_tokens without their interaction,
enable them in the OIDC Configuration section by ticking the checkbox.

When calling the userinfo_endpoint or any ZITADEL API, we will check if an origin header is sent. This is automatically done
by the user agent. If one is sent we will check if the origin is allowed for your application. By default, all computed
origins of the redirect_uri list are allowed.
So if your native app is built with a JavaScript base framework like ReactNative and you only specified redirect_uris
with a custom protocol, you will need to add the origin where the app is served from, e.g. `http://localhost:8100`.
