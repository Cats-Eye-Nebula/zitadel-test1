#### redirect_uri

Native clients might have to register more than one `redirect_uri`, as different operating systems can have different requirements.
Typically, you register a `redirect_uri` starting with a custom protocol, e.g. `ch.zitadel.app://callback`.
You're also allowed to use http://localhost, http://127.0.0.1 and http:[::1] without specifying a port: `http://locahost/callback`.

#### post creation actions

After you create the application, you might want to set additional options like `refresh_token` and `additional origins`.

If you want to request `refresh_tokens` and use them to renew the user's `access_tokens` without their interaction,
enable them in the OIDC Configuration section by ticking the checkbox.

When you call the `userinfo_endpoint`, or any ZITADEL API, we check whether an origin header is sent.
The user agent does this automatically.
If an origin header is sent, we check whether the origin is allowed for your application.
By default, all computed origins of the `redirect_uri` list are allowed.
So if your native app is built with a JavaScript base framework, like ReactNative, and you specified only a `redirect_uri`
with a custom protocol, you need to add the origin where the app is served from, e.g. `http://localhost:8100`.

### Additional parameters and customization

To customize the user's authentication flow, there are additional parameters and values you can provide to satisfy your use case.
Please check the [authorization_endpoint reference](/docs/apis/openidoauth/endpoints#authorization_endpoint) in the OAuth / OIDC documentation.


## Callback

No matter whether the `authorization_endpoint` response returns a success message or an error,
the authorization server will call the callback endpoint that you provided in the `redirect_uri`.

:::note
If no `redirect_uri` is registered, or if anything else prevents the auth server from returning the response to the client,
the error is displayed directly on the auth server.
:::

Upon successful authentication, you'll be given a `code` and, if provided, the unmodified `state` parameter.
You will need this `code` in the token request.

If a parameter is missing, malformed, or any other error occurred, your answer will contain an `error`.
This error states the error type, and possibly gives an `error_description`, which provides some information about the error, its reason, and the `state` parameter.
Check the [error response section](/docs/apis/openidoauth/endpoints#error-response) in the authorization_endpoint reference.

## Token request

Next you need to exchange the given `code` for the tokens.
For this HTTP POST request (form-urlencoded), you need to provide the following:

- `code`: the code that was issued from the authorization request
- `grant_type`: must be `authorization_code`
- `redirect_uri`: callback URI where the code was sent to. Must match exactly the `redirect_uri` of the authorization request

Depending on your authentication method you'll need additional headers and parameters:

Send your `client_id` and the previously generated string as `code_verifier` for us to recompute the `code_challenge` of the authorization request:

```curl
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/token \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data grant_type=authorization_code \
--data code=${code} \
--data redirect_uri=${redirect_uri} \
--data client_id=${client_id} \
--data code_verifier=${code_verifier}
```
