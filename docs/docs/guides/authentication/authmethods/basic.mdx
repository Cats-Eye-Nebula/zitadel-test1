#### redirect_uri

After selecting the authentication method, you can register a `redirect_uri` and `post_logout_redirect_uri`.
After the user authenticates, the `redirect_uri` is called for code exchange.

Typically one `redirect_uri` is enough, but you can have multiple.
If you need to distinguish between different scenarios,
we recommend using the `state` parameter.
If you need to distinguish different environments, we recommend using multiple projects.

## Auth Request

To initialize the user authentication, create an authorization request to `/authorize`, using the HTTP GET method in the user agent (browser).
The request needs at least the following parameters:

- `client_id`: how the authorization server knows which application it is. Copy from the console.
- `redirect_uri`: where the authorization code is sent to after user authentication. Must be one of the registered URIs in the previous step.
- `response_type`: whether you want to have a code (authorization code flow) or a token (implicit flow). Whenever possible, use `code`
- `scope`: what scope you want to grant to the access_token / id_token, minimum is `openid`. If you're unsure what you need, you might start with `openid profile email`

We recommend always using two additional parameters: `state` and `nonce`.
`State` lets you to transfer a state through the authentication process.
`Nonce` is used to bind the client session with the `id_token`, and to mitigate replay attacks.

You don't need any additional parameters for this request.
We identify the app by the `client_id` parameter.

So your request might look like this (linebreaks and whitespace for display reasons):

```curl
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://accounts.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/authorize
    ?client_id=${client_id}
    &redirect_uri=${redirect_uri}
    &response_type=code
    &scope=openid%20email%20profile'
```

### Additional parameters and customization

To customize the user's authentication flow, there are additional parameters and values you can provide to satisfy your use case.
Please check the [authorization_endpoint reference](/docs/apis/openidoauth/endpoints#authorization_endpoint) in the OAuth / OIDC documentation.

## Callback

No matter whether the `authorization_endpoint` response returns a success message or an error,
the authorization server will call the callback endpoint that you provided in the `redirect_uri`.

:::note
If no `redirect_uri` is registered, or if anything else prevents the auth server from returning the response to the client,
the error is displayed directly on the auth server.
:::

Upon successful authentication, you'll be given a `code` and, if provided, the unmodified `state` parameter.
You will need this `code` in the token request.

If a parameter is missing, malformed, or any other error occurred, your answer will contain an `error`.
This error states the error type, and possibly gives an `error_description`, which provides some information about the error, its reason, and the `state` parameter.
Check the [error response section](/docs/apis/openidoauth/endpoints#error-response) in the authorization_endpoint reference.

## Token request

Next you need to exchange the given `code` for the tokens. For this HTTP POST request (form-urlencoded), you need to provide the following:

- `code`: the code that was issued from the authorization request
- `grant_type`: must be `authorization_code`
- `redirect_uri`: callback URI where the code was sent to. Must match exactly the `redirect_uri` of the authorization request

Depending on your authentication method, you'll need additional headers and parameters:

Send your `client_id` and `client_secret` as Basic Auth Header.
Note that OAuth2 requires `client_id` and `client_secret` to be form url encoded.
So check [Client Secret Basic Auth Method](/docs/apis/openidoauth/authn-methods#client-secret-basic) for instructions about how to build it correctly.

```curl
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/token \
--header 'Authorization: Basic ${basic}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data grant_type=authorization_code \
--data code=${code} \
--data redirect_uri=${redirect_uri}
```
