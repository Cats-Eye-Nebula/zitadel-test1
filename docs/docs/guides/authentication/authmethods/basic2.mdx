You don't need any additional parameter for this request. We're identifying the app by the `client_id` parameter.

So your request might look like this (linebreaks and whitespace for display reasons):

```curl
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://accounts.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/authorize
    ?client_id=${client_id}
    &redirect_uri=${redirect_uri}
    &response_type=code
    &scope=openid%20email%20profile'
```
