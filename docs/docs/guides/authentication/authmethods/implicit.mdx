:::caution Security Notice
In contrast to the Code Flow, where you'll receive a code for token exchange, with the implicit flow you'll receive
the tokens directly from the authorization endpoint. This is unsecure and might lead to token leakage and replay attacks.
It will further be removed in OAuth 2.1 for the exact same reason.

We therefore discourage the use of Implicit Flow and do not cover the flow in this guide.
:::

If you still need to rely on the implicit flow, simply keep in mind that the response on the authorization_endpoint is
the same you would be given on the token_endpoint and check the [OAuth / OIDC endpoint documentation](../../../apis/openidoauth/endpoints.md) for more information.
