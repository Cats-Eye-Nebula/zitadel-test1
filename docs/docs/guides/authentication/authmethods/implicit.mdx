:::caution Security Notice
In contrast to the Code Flow, where you'll receive a code for token exchange, with the implicit flow you'll receive
the tokens directly from the authorization endpoint. This is unsecure and might lead to token leakage and replay attacks.
It will further be removed in OAuth 2.1 for the exact same reason.

We therefore discourage the use of Implicit Flow and do not cover the flow in this guide.
:::

If you still need to rely on the implicit flow, simply keep in mind that the response on the authorization_endpoint is
the same you would be given on the token_endpoint and check the [OAuth / OIDC endpoint documentation](../../../apis/openidoauth/endpoints.md) for more information.

#### redirect_uri

After selecting the authentication method, you can register a redirect_uri and post_logout_redirect_uri.
The redirect_uri will be called after user authentication for code exchange.

You can even register multiple, but typically one will be enough. If you need to distinguish between different scenarios
or environments we recommend using the `state` parameter for the former and multiple projects for the latter.

## Auth Request

To initialize the user authentication, you will have to create an authorization request using HTTP GET in the user agent (browser)
on /authorize with at least the following parameters:

- `client_id`: this tells the authorization server which application it is, copy from Console
- `redirect_uri`: where the authorization code is sent to after the user authentication, must be one of the registered in the previous step
- `response_type`: if you want to have a code (authorization code flow) or directly a token (implicit flow), so when ever possible use `code`
- `scope`: what scope you want to grant to the access_token / id_token, minimum is `openid`, if you're unsure what you need you might start with `openid profile email`

We recommend always using two additional parameters `state` and `nonce`. The former enables you to transfer a state through
the authentication process. The latter is used to bind the client session with the id_token and to mitigate replay attacks.

### Additional parameters and customization

There are additional parameters and values you can provide to satisfy your use case and to customize the user's authentication flow.
Please check the [authorization_endpoint reference](../../apis/openidoauth/endpoints#authorization_endpoint) in the OAuth / OIDC documentation.
