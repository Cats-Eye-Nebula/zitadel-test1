:::caution Security Notice
In contrast to the Code Flow, where you'll receive a code for token exchange, with the implicit flow you'll receive
the tokens directly from the authorization endpoint. This is unsecure and might lead to token leakage and replay attacks.
For this exact reason, OAuth 2.1 will remove implicit flow.

We therefore discourage the use of Implicit Flow and do not cover the flow in this guide.
:::

If you still need to rely on implicit flow, note that the `authorization_endpoint` gives the same response that the `token_endpoint` does.
Check the [OAuth / OIDC endpoint documentation](/docs/apis/openidoauth/endpoints) for more information.

#### redirect_uri

After selecting the authentication method, you can register a `redirect_uri` and `post_logout_redirect_uri`.
After the user authenticates, the `redirect_uri` is called for code exchange.

Typically one `redirect_uri` is enough, but you can have multiple.
If you need to distinguish between different scenarios,
we recommend using the `state` parameter.
If you need to distinguish different environments, we recommend using multiple projects.

## Auth Request

To initialize the user authentication, create an authorization request to `/authorize`, using the HTTP GET method in the user agent (browser).
The request needs at least the following parameters:

- `client_id`: how the authorization server knows which application it is. Copy from Console.
- `redirect_uri`: where the authorization code is sent to after user authentication. Must be one of the registered URIs in the previous step.
- `response_type`: whether you want to have a code (authorization code flow) or a token (implicit flow). Whenever possible, use `code`
- `scope`: what scope you want to grant to the access_token / id_token, minimum is `openid`. If you're unsure what you need, you might start with `openid profile email`

When using the Implicit Flow, provide a `nonce` parameter to bind the client session to the `id_token` and to mitigate replay attacks.
Furthermore, we recommend using a `state` parameter, which lets
you to transfer a state through the authentication process.

### Additional parameters and customization

To customize the user's authentication flow, there are additional parameters and values you can provide to satisfy your use case.
Please check the [authorization_endpoint reference](/docs/apis/openidoauth/endpoints#authorization_endpoint) in the OAuth / OIDC documentation.

## Callback

No matter wheter the `authorization_endpoint` response returns a success message or an error,
the authorization server will call your callback endpoint you provided by the `redirect_uri`.

:::note
If no `redirect_uri` is registered, or if anything else prevents the auth server from returning the response to the client,
the error is displayed directly on the auth server.
:::

Upon successful authentication, you'll be given the `access_token`, `id_token`, `expires_in` and, if provided, the unmodified `state` parameter, as you would be given from the `token_endpoint` when using Authorization Code Flow.

If a parameter is missing, malformed, or any other error occurred, your answer will contain an `error`.
This error states the error type, and possibly gives an `error_description`, which provides some information about the error, its reason, and the `state` parameter.
Check the [error response section](/docs/apis/openidoauth/endpoints#error-response) in the authorization_endpoint reference.
