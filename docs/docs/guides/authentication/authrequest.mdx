## Auth Request

To initialize the user authentication, you will have to create an authorization request using HTTP GET in the user agent (browser)
on /authorize with at least the following parameters:

- `client_id`: this tells the authorization server which application it is, copy from Console
- `redirect_uri`: where the authorization code is sent to after the user authentication, must be one of the registered in the previous step
- `response_type`: if you want to have a code (authorization code flow) or directly a token (implicit flow), so when ever possible use `code`
- `scope`: what scope you want to grant to the access_token / id_token, minimum is `openid`, if you're unsure what you need you might start with `openid profile email`

We recommend always using two additional parameters `state` and `nonce`. The former enables you to transfer a state through
the authentication process. The latter is used to bind the client session with the id_token and to mitigate replay attacks.
