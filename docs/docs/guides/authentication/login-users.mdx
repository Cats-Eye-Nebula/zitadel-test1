## Overview

This guide shows you how to use ZITADEL to *authenticate* your app's users.
That is, it shows you how to use ZITADEL to log users in to your app.
It guides you step-by-step through the basics and points out on how to customize the process.

## OIDC / OAuth Flow

OAuth (and therefore OIDC) recognize three different application types:

- Web (Server-side web applications such as java, .net, ...)
- Native (native, mobile, or desktop applications)
- User Agent (single page applications / SPA, generally JavaScript executed in the browser)

Depending on the app type you're trying to register, there are small process differences.
Regardless of the type you use, we recommend  *Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)*.
The [Recommended Authorization Flows](../authorization/oauth-recommended-flows#different-client-profiles)
page explains why we recommend PKCE.

### About the authorization code flow

For a basic understanding of OAuth and its flows, we'll briefly describe the most important flow: **Authorization Code**.

The following diagram demonstrates a basic authorization_code flow:

![Authorization Code Flow](/img/guides/auth_flow.png)

1. An unauthenticated user visits your application.
2. You create an authorization request to the authorization endpoint.
3. The Authorization Server (ZITADEL) sends an HTTP `302` to the user's browser, which redirects the user to the login UI.
4. The user has to authenticate using the demanded auth mechanics.
5. Your application calls on the registered callback path (redirect_uri) and will be provided an authorization_code.
6. This authorization_code must then be sent together with your applications authentication (`client_id` + `client_secret`) to the token endpoint_.
7. In exchange, the Authorization Server (ZITADEL) returns an `access_token`, and, if requested, a `refresh_token`. In the case of OIDC, it returns an id_token as well.
8. The `access_token` can then be used to call a Resource Server (API). The token is be sent as an Authorization Header.

This flow is the same when using PKCE or JWT with Private Key for authentication.

## Create Application

To create an application:

1. Open your project in Console
2. Select the **New** button in the **Application** section.

This starts a wizard, asking you for an application name and a type.

<Tabs
    groupId="app-type"
    default="web"
    values={[
        {'label': 'Web Application', 'value': 'web'},
        {'label': 'Native Application', 'value': 'native'},
        {'label': 'Single Page Application', 'value': 'spa'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value="web">

#### Authentication method

After selecting WEB, choose an authentication method. We recommend using PKCE.
For even better security, you could switch to JWT, or just rely on the standard Code Flow.
For security reasons, we don't recommend using POST and do not cover it in this guide.

If you changed the authentication method in the wizard, change it here as well.
This improves how the wizard guides you through the process:

<AuthMethods selected="web" />
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="native">

#### Authentication method

When selecting Native, the authentication method always needs to be PKCE.

<AuthMethods selected="native" />
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="spa">

#### Authentication method

When selecting SPA, the recommended authentication method is again PKCE.
All common Frameworks, like Angular, React, Vue.js, can successfully authenticate with PKCE.
Our Managament UI Console, for instance, uses PKCE as well.

<AuthMethods selected="spa" />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
