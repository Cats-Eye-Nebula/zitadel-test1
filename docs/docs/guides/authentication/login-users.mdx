## Overview

This guide will show you how to use ZITADEL to login users into your application (authentication).
It will guide you step-by-step through the basics and point out on how to customize process.

## OIDC / OAuth Flow

OAuth and therefore OIDC know three different application types:

- Web (Server-side web applications such as java, .net, ...)
- Native (native, mobile or desktop applications)
- User Agent (single page applications / SPA, generally JavaScript executed in the browser)

Depending on the app type you're trying to register, there are small differences.
But regardless of the app type we recommend using Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).

Please read the following guide about the [different-client-profiles](../authorization/oauth-recommended-flows#different-client-profiles) and why to use PKCE.

### Code Flow

For a basic understanding of OAuth and its flows, we'll briefly describe the most important flow: **Authorization Code**.

The following diagram demonstrates a basic authorization_code flow:

![Authorization Code Flow](/img/guides/auth_flow.png)

1. When an unauthenticated user visits your application,
2. you will create an authorization request to the authorization endpoint.
3. The Authorization Server (ZITADEL) will send an HTTP 302 to the user's browser, which will redirect him to the login UI.
4. The user will have to authenticate using the demanded auth mechanics.
5. Your application will be called on the registered callback path (redirect_uri) and be provided an authorization_code.
6. This authorization_code must then be sent together with you applications authentication (client_id + client_secret) to the token_endpoint
7. In exchange the Authorization Server (ZITADEL) will return an access_token and if requested a refresh_token and in the case of OIDC an id_token as well
8. The access_token can then be used to call a Resource Server (API). The token will be sent as Authorization Header.

This flow is the same when using PKCE or JWT with Private Key for authentication.

## Create Application

To create an application, open your project in Console and start by clicking on the "New" button in the Application section.

#### Application type

This will start a wizard asking you for an application name and a type.

<Tabs
    groupId="app-type"
    default="web"
    values={[
        {'label': 'Web Application', 'value': 'web'},
        {'label': 'Native Application', 'value': 'native'},
        {'label': 'Single Page Application', 'value': 'spa'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value="web">

#### Authentication method

After selecting WEB, you'll next have to choose an authentication method. As mentioned before we recommend using PKCE.
For even better security you could switch to JWT or just rely on the standard Code Flow. For security reasons we don't
recommend using POST and will not cover it in this guide.

Please change the authentication method here as well, if you did so in the wizard, so we can better guide you through the process:

<AuthMethods selected="web" />
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="native">

#### Authentication method

When selecting Native the authentication method always needs to be PKCE.

<AuthMethods selected="native" />
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="spa">

#### Authentication method

When selecting SPA the recommended authentication method is again PKCE. All common Frameworks like Angular, React, Vue.js and so on
are able to successfully authenticate with PKCE. Our Managament UI Console for instance uses PKCE as well.

<AuthMethods selected="spa" />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Additional parameters and customization

There are additional parameters and values you can provide to satisfy your use case and to customize the user's authentication flow.
Please check the [authorization_endpoint reference](../../apis/openidoauth/endpoints#authorization_endpoint) in the OAuth / OIDC documentation.

## Callback

Regardless of a successful or error response from the authorization_endpoint, the authorization server will call your
callback endpoint you provided by the `redirect_uri`.

:::note
If the redirect_uri is not provided, was not registered or anything other prevents the auth server form returning the response to the client,
the error will be display directly to the user on the auth server.
:::

Upon successful authentication you'll be given a `code` and if provided the unmodified `state` parameter.
You will need this `code` in the token request.

If a parameter was missing, malformed or any other error occurred, your answer will contain an `error` stating the error type,
possibly an `error_description` providing some information about the error and its reason and the `state` parameter.
Check the [error response section](../../apis/openidoauth/endpoints#error-response) in the authorization_endpoint reference.

## Token request

Next you will have to exchange the given `code` for the tokens. For this HTTP POST request (form-urlencoded) you will need to provide the following:

- code: the code that was issued from the authorization request
- grant_type: must be `authorization_code`
- redirect_uri: callback uri where the code was sent to. Must match exactly the redirect_uri of the authorization request

Depending on your authentication method you'll need additional headers and parameters:

<Tabs
    groupId="auth-type"
    defaultValue="pkce"
    values={[
        {label: 'PKCE', value: 'pkce'},
        {label: 'Basic Auth', value: 'basic'},
        {label: 'JWT with Private Key', value: 'jwt'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value="pkce">

Send your `client_id` and the previously generated string as `code_verifier` for us to recompute the `code_challenge` of the authorization request:

```curl
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/token \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data grant_type=authorization_code \
--data code=${code} \
--data redirect_uri=${redirect_uri} \
--data client_id=${client_id} \
--data code_verifier=${code_verifier}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="basic">

Send your `client_id` and `client_secret` as Basic Auth Header. Note that OAuth2 requires client_id and client_secret to be form url encoded.
So check [Client Secret Basic Auth Method](../../apis/openidoauth/authn-methods#client-secret-basic) on how to build it correctly.

```curl
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/token \
--header 'Authorization: Basic ${basic}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data grant_type=authorization_code \
--data code=${code} \
--data redirect_uri=${redirect_uri}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="jwt">

Send a JWT in the `client_assertion` and set the `client_assertion_type` to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`
for us to validate the signature against the registered public key:

```curl
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.zitadel.ch/oauth/v2/token \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data grant_type=authorization_code \
--data code=${code} \
--data redirect_uri=${redirect_uri} \
--data client_assertion=${client_assertion} \
--data client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
