Users within ZITADEL are your human application users, but can also be for service purpose.

A human user has an email address and a password, and can additionally save information about phone, nickname, gender, language.
A service user only has a name and a description aside his username.

A service user can be authenticated with JWT profile or Personal Access Tokens. Both methods can specify an expiry.
A human user can authenticate itself with his password, add multiple factors for additional security, and enable passwordless authentication.

Service users are primarily used to gain access for a backend service or iot device. The fact that service users can also be ZITADEL managers is used to restrict access to specific projects or organizations.
To get an understanding on how service users are used, take a look at our NextJS B2B Demo application.

To create a new user, go to Users and click “New”. Enter the required contact details and save by clicking “Create”.

To grant users certain roles, you need to create authorizations. Go back to the project, and jump to the section AUTHORIZATIONS.

You can verify the role grant on the user. Select Users from the navigation menu and click on the user Coyote. Scroll down to the section AUTHORIZATION, there you should be able to verify that the user has the role ‘reader’ for your project ‘My first project’.
