To grant users certain roles, you need to create authorizations. Go back to the project, and jump to the section AUTHORIZATIONS.

You can verify the role grant on the user. Select Users from the navigation menu and click on the user Coyote. Scroll down to the section AUTHORIZATION, there you should be able to verify that the user has the role ‘reader’ for your project ‘My first project’.
