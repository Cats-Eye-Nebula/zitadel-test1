## What is a project?

import ProjectDescription from '../../../concepts/structure/_project_description.mdx';

<ProjectDescription name="ProjectDescription" />

The goal of this module is to give you an overview, but not dive too deep into details around managing access rights and delegating management of roles to third parties. So let’s create a straightforward example project first.

## Create a project

Visit <https://console.zitadel.ch/projects> or select “Projects” within your organization, then click the button to create a new project.

![Empty Project](/img/console_projects_empty.png)

Enter the name “ My first project” and continue.

Let’s make this more interesting and add some basic roles and authorizations to your project and then confirm the scope of the roles and authorizations.

Jump to the section ROLES and create two new roles with the following values

* Key: reader
* Display Name: Reader
* Group: user

and

* Key: editor
* Display Name: Editor
* Group: user

Now, you can add roles to your own user, or you can create a new user. To create a new user, go to Users and click “New”. Enter the required contact details and save by clicking “Create”.

To grant users certain roles, you need to create authorizations. Go back to the project, and jump to the section AUTHORIZATIONS.

![Verify your authorization](/img/console_projects_create_authorization.gif)

You can verify the role grant on the user. Select Users from the navigation menu and click on the user Coyote. Scroll down to the section AUTHORIZATION, there you should be able to verify that the user has the role ‘reader’ for your project ‘My first project’.

Now create another project (eg. “My second project”) and verify that there are no roles or authorizations on your second project.

## What is a granted project?

import GrantedProjectDescription from '../../../concepts/structure/_granted_project_description.mdx';

<GrantedProjectDescription name="GrantedProjectDescription" />

## Grant a project

1. Visit the project that you have created before, then in the section GRANTED ORGANIZATIONS click New.
2. Enter the domain ‘acme.caos.ch’, search the organization and continue to the next step.
3. Select some roles you would like to grant to the organization ACME and confirm.
4. You should now see ACME-CAOS in the section GRANTED ORGANIZATIONS
