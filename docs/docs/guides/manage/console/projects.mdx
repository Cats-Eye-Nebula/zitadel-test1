## What is a project?

import ProjectDescription from "../../../concepts/structure/_project_description.mdx";

<ProjectDescription name="ProjectDescription" />

### Example

If you'd build a Point of Sales Platform, you would have one Project (maybe called `POS`) and all your applications (one Webapplication for administration, and your mobile applications for your users iOS and Android), would be part of it.
You would have to create roles for administration and your clients in this very project, and then create authorizations based on them.

## Create a project

To create a project, navigate to your organization, then projects or directly via <https://{your_domain}.zitadel.cloud/ui/console/projects>, and then click the button to create a new project.

<img alt="Empty Project" src="/img/console_projects_empty.png" width="270px" />

then enter your project name and continue.

Let’s make this more interesting and add some basic roles and authorizations to your project and then confirm the scope of the roles and authorizations.

Jump to the section ROLES and create two new roles with the following values

- Key: reader
- Display Name: Reader
- Group: user

and

- Key: editor
- Display Name: Editor
- Group: user

Now, you can add roles to your own user, or you can create a new user. To create a new user, go to Users and click “New”. Enter the required contact details and save by clicking “Create”.

To grant users certain roles, you need to create authorizations. Go back to the project, and jump to the section AUTHORIZATIONS.

![Verify your authorization](/img/console_projects_create_authorization.gif)

You can verify the role grant on the user. Select Users from the navigation menu and click on the user Coyote. Scroll down to the section AUTHORIZATION, there you should be able to verify that the user has the role ‘reader’ for your project ‘My first project’.

Now create another project (eg. “My second project”) and verify that there are no roles or authorizations on your second project.

## What is a granted project?

import GrantedProjectDescription from "../../../concepts/structure/_granted_project_description.mdx";

<GrantedProjectDescription name="GrantedProjectDescription" />

## Grant a project

1. Visit the project that you have created before, then in the section GRANTED ORGANIZATIONS click New.
2. Enter the domain ‘acme.caos.ch’, search the organization and continue to the next step.
3. Select some roles you would like to grant to the organization ACME and confirm.
4. You should now see ACME-CAOS in the section GRANTED ORGANIZATIONS
