## What is an application?

Applications are the entry point to your project. Users either login into one of your clients and interact with them directly or use one of your API, maybe without even knowing. All applications share the roles and authorizations of their project.

## Application types

If you create a new application in ZITADEL Console you have to choose the type of your application. But which one do you have to choose?

Detailed information about authentication types can be found [here](../../authentication/login-users#create-application).

### Web

Server side rendered applications users interact with. For example if you develop an application using Thymeleaf in Java or Razor in .NET or want to enable SSO in Gitlab.

Following authentication types can be used:

<AuthType appType="web"/>

### Native

Applications installed on a thin client. For example on a smartphone or computer. 

These applications uses the Key file generated by ZITADEL to authenticate.

<AuthType appType="native"/>

### User Agent

Applications that are executed in a web browser, for example single page applications executed in the browser developed with JavaScript frameworks like [Angular](../../../examples/login/angular) or [React](../../../examples/login/react)

Following authentication types can be used:

<AuthType appType="user-agent"/>

### API

Applications without human interaction. These applications are accessed by other applications, so called machine to machine communication.

Following authentication types can be used:

<AuthType appType="api"/>

## Redirect URIs

<RedirectURIs appType="web"/>

## Review Configuration

<ReviewConfig authType="code"/>

## Generate key for private key JWT

<GenerateKey appType="api"/>
