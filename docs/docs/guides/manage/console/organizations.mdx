## What is an organization?

import OrgDescription from "../../../concepts/structure/_org_description.mdx";
import Column from "../../../../src/components/column";

An Organization is where your projects and users live. Users from one organization are seperated from others.

## Create a new organization

To create a new organization, click on the organizations dropdown and then select “New organization”.
You can either create a new organization with your logged in user as the organization manager or directly create another account.

If you want to enable you customers to create their organization by themselves, we provide a creation form for a organization. <https://{your-domain}-{random string}.zitadel.cloud/ui/login/register/org>
The customer needs to fill in the form with the organization name and the contact details.

## How ZITADEL handles usernames

As we mentioned before, each organization has its own pool of usernames, which includes human and service.

This means that, for example a user with the username road.runner, can only exist once in an organization called ACME. ZITADEL will automatically generate a "logonname" for each consisting of `{username}@{domainname}.{zitadeldomain}`, in our example road.runner@acme.zitadel.cloud.

When you verify your domain name, then ZITADEL will generate additional logonames for each user with the verified domain. If our example organization would own the domain acme.ch and verify within the organization ACME, then the resulting logonname in our example would be road.runner@acme.ch in addition to the already generated road.runner@acme.zitadel.cloud. The user can now use either logonname to authenticate with your application.

Another option is to use your users email to login. To enable this setting, navigate to your instance settings, then

## Domain verification and primary domain

Once you have successfully registered your organization, ZITADEL will automatically generate a domain name for your organization (eg, acme.zitadel.cloud). Users that you create within your organization will be suffixed with this domain name.

You can improve the user experience, by suffixing users with a domain name that is in your control. If the "validate ord domains" settings in the [Domain Policy](../../../concepts/structure/policies) is set to true, you have to prove the ownership of your domain, by DNS or HTTP challenge.
If the settings is set to false, the created domain will automatically be set to verifed.

An organization can have multiple domain names, but only one domain can be primary. The primary domain defines which login name ZITADEL displays to the user, and what information gets asserted in access_tokens (`preferred_username`).

Please note that domain verification also removes the logonname from all users, who might have used this combination in the global organization (ie. users not belonging to a specific organization). Relating to our example with acme.ch: If a user ‘coyote’ exists in the global organization with the logonname coyote@acme.ch, then after verification of acme.ch, this logonname will be replaced with `coyote@{randomvalue.tld}`. ZITADEL will notify users affected by this change.

## Verify your domain name

1. Browse to your organization
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. To start the domain verification click the domain name and a dialog will appear, where you can choose between DNS or HTTP challenge methods.
4. For example, create a TXT record with your DNS provider for the used domain and click verify. ZITADEL will then proceed and check your DNS.
5. When the verification is successful you have the option to activate the domain by clicking **Set as primary**
