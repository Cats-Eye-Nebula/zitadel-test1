An Identity and Management system is a very interactive place. ZITADEL has built in functionality to react to its events. This functionality is called **Actions** and can be accessed from your organizations top navigation.

Actions allow you to define scripts which are executed with Webassembly, which are then run on certain triggers.
To run those scripts, a flow with a trigger has to be created.
This could for example be a **External Authentication** Flow, with a **Post Authentication** trigger.
