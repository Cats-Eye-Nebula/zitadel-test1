## What is console?

Console is the Dashboard UI for your instance. It can be accessed from all configured instance domains, defined in the Customer Portal.
The console is used to configure global instance settings and can be used by multiple Managers.
Read more about [Console Managers](./managers) here.

When you are logged in, you are greeted by the home page. This page allows you to set shortcuts to settings and projects.
The console has a context switcher on the top-left where your current organization is set.
Depending on your use case, multiple organizations can be set (B2B). Otherwise the global organization is preselected. To get an understanding of your use cases read the [Solution Scenario](../../solution-scenarios/introduction) guides.

If your new to console, you'll probably want to set some settings initially. Continue reading instance settings on the next page.
