## Update Billing Information

:::note
This part happens in the [ZITADEL Cloud Customer Portal](https://zitadel.cloud)
:::

You will only need to add billing information if your instance is in the paid tier. There are two options on how to add your billing info.
1. Go to the billing menu and add a new payment method. You will be able to choose the added method, when upgrading the instance to the paid tier.
2. Add the billing information directly during the upgrade process.
