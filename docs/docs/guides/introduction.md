With our guides you will learn everything you need to know about specific topics. You get step-by-step instructions for certain tasks and have a knowledge check at the end.

You can either use our cloud-instance [zitadel.ch](https://zitadel.ch) or deploy a dedicated **ZITADEL** instance. To get started, we recommend you to try out our free tier first. Jump directly to the [get started](./basics/get-started) docs.

When you are familiar with the ZITADEL usage, you can choose to stay on [zitadel.ch](./installation/shared-cloud), order your own [dedicated instance](./installation/shared-cloud) which is also availabe on premise, or install ZITADEL easily on your own using [Custom Kubernetes Resources](./installation/crd), [GitOps](./installation/gitops) or [ORBOS](./installation/orbos).
