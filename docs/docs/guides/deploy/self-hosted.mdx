title: ZITADEL Self-Hosted
---

Choose your platform and run ZITADEL with the most minimal configuration possible.
For an easy self-hosted production setup, we recommend running ZITADEL on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/), using our official [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/) chart.
By default, it runs a highly available ZITADEL instance along with a secure and highly available [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/) instance.
