title: Overview
---

Choose your platform and run ZITADEL with the most minimal configuration possible.
For an easy self-hosted production setup, we recommend running ZITADEL on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/), using our official [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/) chart.
By default, it runs a highly available ZITADEL instance along with a secure and highly available [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/) instance.

- [Linux](./linux)
- [MacOS](./macos)
- [Docker Compose](./compose)
- [Knative](./knative)
- [Kubernetes](./kubernetes)

## Prerequisits

- ZITADEL does not need much resource 1 CPU and 512MB memory is more than enough. (With more CPU the password hashing might be faster)
- A cockroachDB or [ðŸš§ Postgresql coming soon](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/pull/3998) as only needed storage
- If you want to front ZTIADEL with a revers proxy, web application firewall or content delivery network make sure to support [HTTP/2](../manage/self-hosted/http2)
