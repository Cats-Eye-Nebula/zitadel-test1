## Introduction

When building your own application, one of the first questions you have to face, is how do my customers onboard to my application.
This guide will show you the built-in solution you have, within ZITADEL and how you can use ZITADEL when you have more advanced needs.

### Onboarding Process for B2B Customers

When you want to build an onboarding process for your business customers you have to go through the following steps:
1. Create an organization: The organization represents the customer or a team
2. Create the first administrator user: This user is the account for your customer, which should be able to configure settings such as SSO, MFA, etc.
3. Give the user the correct permission to be able to configure settings, create users and assign roles to users

ZITADEL does have multiple possibilities on how to achieve that process.

## Built-in register organization form

A basic form that allows a customer to enter an organization name and a user account is hosted on the follwing URL:
{custom-domain}/ui/login/register/org

When a user registers through this form, an organization and a user are created.
The user will automatically get the role "ORG_OWNER" withing ZITADEL and is able to manage the whole organization.
You can read more about the managers, roles and there meanings [here](/docs/guides/manage/console/managers)

If you do not want to allow users to register organizations with this form, you can disable it with the following request:
[Restrict the instance features](/docs/apis/resources/admin/admin-service-set-restrictions)
