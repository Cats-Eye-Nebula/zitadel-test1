This guide should explain how domain discovery works and how to configure it in ZITADEL.

## Overview

Domain discovery is typically used in [B2B](./b2b) or [SaaS](./saas) scenarios where you have users from different organizations and you want to route them according to their login methods, which could be a user name or, depending on your configuration, also an [email / phone number](configurations#use-email-to-login).

In the example there is a service provider with a ZITADEL instance running on a [custom domain](/docs/guides/manage/cloud/instances#add-custom-domain) on `login.mycompany.com`.
By default all users login on the organization **CIAM** with their preferred social login provider.

Users of the two business customers Alpha and Beta should login according to their organization login and access policy settings.
In case of Alpha users will login via an external identity provider (eg, [AzureAD](/docs/guides/integrate/identity-providers/azure-ad)).
Beta users must only login with username/password and MFA instead.

For this scenario you need to route the user `alice@alpha.com` to the Alpha Organization and `bob@beta.com` to the Beta Organization respectively.
Follow this guide to configure your ZITADEL instance for this scenario.
