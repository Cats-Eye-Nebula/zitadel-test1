In _Business to Customer (B2C)_ scenarios, your organization works directly with individual users.
This is different from typical [B2B](./b2b) cases, where the organization often interacts with other organizations.

## Business to Consumer

Users come with different needs.
You may have end users, employees, or even customers from other parties (B2B).
These groups of users rarely want to use an app to do the exact same thing.

When planning your applications, be sure to research your users' use cases and your app's architecture.
This is vital for later feature upgrades and enhancements.
Bigger changes come with heftier price points.

This topic introduces you to the grouping and structure that forms the basis of all ZITADEL projects.
The concepts also carry over to B2B scenarios.
The [B2B scenarios topic](./b2b) focuses on planning considerations when you have projects with multiple organizations.

Everything in the following sections assumes you've created an organization.
An organization is the outermost layer of ZITADEL.
It is the vessel for projects, roles, applications and users.
You can create an organization from the [ZITADEL console](https://console.zitadel.ch/org/create).
You can either choose your current account for the organization owner, or create a new one.

Depending on your *Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)*, you can create multiple organizations or projects, keeping your application environments separated.

### Custom domains

After you create an organization, you'll be greeted with the domain section of your organization.
ZITADEL automatically creates a custom domain in the form `[orgname].zitadel.ch`, but you can set your own by saving a verification file in the specified location.
    
We recommend that you create your domains early.
This creates a sense of confidence and trust for your application.
Additionally, changing the domain later might create extra migration effort.

### Data Provisioning

ZITADEL provides basic storage for users.
It manages phone and email addresses,
and also allows you to store your own application data, like preferences or external identifiers, with the user's metadata.

If you are migrating an existing project and already have an external identity store, consider bulk importing your user datasets.
Read our [Management API definitions](../../apis/proto/management#importhumanuser) for more info.
If the user's email is not verified, or if no password is set, ZITADEL sends an initialization email.

Requests to the management API are rate limited. Read our [Rate limit Policy](../../legal/rate-limit-policy) for more info.

### User Authentication

There are multiple ways to perform _User Authentication_.
The default method in ZITADEL is with a username and password with _Mulitifactor Authentication (MFA)_ enabled.
To provide good user security, ZITADEL lets you to configure _MFA_ and passwordless authentication.
All authentication methods are available from the FREE Tier.
To set up your organization's login policy, go to your organization's detail in the ZITADEL [console](https://console.zitadel.ch/org).

When planning your application, consider the following questions about User Authentication:

- What are the methods to authenticate your users?
- Where will your users enter their credentials?
- Do you offer password authentication?
- What do you do to keep user credentials safe?
- Do you offer *Multifactor Authentication*?
- Do you offer Login via an identity provider?
- Which languages do you have to provide?

Considering these questions, you might admit that building an identity management system is more complex than you initially thought.
Implementing it yourself might be too much work, especially if you want to focus on building your applications.

### Federation

ZITADEL supports signup with *OIDC* identity providers, as well as *JWT* identity providers.
On signup, ZITADEL imports user information to their own profile.

### Hosted Login

ZITADEL's approach is _secure by default_.
It comes with a *Hosted Login*, a fixed endpoint for your users to authenticate.
It's safe and secure and comes with Multifactor, Federated Login and Passwordless capabilities.
*OpenID Connect (OIDC)* opens the doors for *Single Sign On (SSO)*.
Especially if you have more than one application, you may want a central and familiar authentication experience.
With SSO, ZITADEL provides a seamless experience across all your apps.

### Branding

<Column>
<div>

Branding and customization is an important part of your application.
With ZITADEL, you can modify colors, logos, and icons.
You can also configure your typography styles.
These branding customizations let you provide a consistent design throughout your applications.

In addition to visual modifications, you can edit notification texts for your users.
ZITADEL gives you [Handlebars-like templating](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for variables.
Of course you can define texts for any language.
We'd appreciate anyone who contributes to our repo with translations of their language.
[Read about how to contribute](../../guides/customization/texts).

> Note that your console design will also change for your branding.

### Projects and applications

As our hosted login is a separate authentication screen, you have to determine how you direct your users from your applications.
ZITADEL's applications live under ZITADEL's projects.
You may add multiple applications for your different client-types (*Native*, *Web*, *User Agent*, or *API*).
When setting up your applications, consult our [guide about authentication flows](../authentication/login-users).

### Access Control

Having authenticated a user, you need to ensure users and services have access to your application and APIs.
This process is called access control and comprises user authentication, authorization, and policy enforcement.
When implementing access control, consider these questions:

- Does your application call your own APIs?
- Does your application need to call third-party APIs?
- Do you offer an API for third-party applications?

The data required to check whether a user has access to a certain API is stored within a user grant.
This information typically is stored within roles or custom claims.
You can access it with an `access` or *OIDC* `id` token.
