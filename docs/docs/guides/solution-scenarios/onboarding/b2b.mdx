title: Onboarding B2B Customer
sidebar_label: Onboard B2B customer
---

When you want to build an onboarding process for your business customers you have to go through the following steps:
1. Create an organization: The organization represents the customer or a team
2. Create the first administrator user: This user is the account for your customer, which should be able to configure settings such as SSO, MFA, etc.
3. Give the user the correct permission to be able to configure settings, create users and assign roles to users in ZITADEL

As soon as you have the customer and the first administrator ready. Your customers are able to start managing.
The first actions they want to take are the following:
1. Invite Team member
2. Configure SSO
3. Configure Security Settings
4. Configure Branding

ZITADEL does have multiple possibilities on how to achieve that process.

## Onboard in ZITADEL Management Console

Each ZITADEL instance does automatically bring a management console with it. This can be used to manage all your resources through a UI.
You can access it by calling the following URL: $CUSTOM-DOMAIN/ui/
Make sure to authenticate with a user with permissions on an instance level such as "INSTANCE_OWNER"

### Create a customer

You do have two different options to create a new Organization.
1. If you are on a specific organization, click the dropdown in the header and press click "+ New Organization"

2. If you are on the instance level, go to the Organization tab and click the "+ New" button above the Organization list.

No matter which option you choose you will be redirected to the create organization screen.
If the setting "Use your personal account as organization owner" is enabled, your user will automatically get the role "ORG_OWNER" in the orgnaization.
Give the organization a name and create it.

Click on the newly created organization in the list and you will switch your context to that organization.

### Add First Administrator

You now want to create the first user for your customer and ensure the user has enough permissions to self-manage the needed configuration.

#### Create User

import CreateUser from '/docs/guides/manage/console/_create-user.mdx';

<CreateUser/>

#### Add Administrator Role to User

Now you need to give the right administrator role to your user. In this case we want to give "ORG_OWNER".
If you do want to know more about the roles check out the [ZITADEL Managers Guide with the Role List](/docs/guides/manage/console/managers)

Go to the detail page of the organization and select the "+" button in the top right corner, where you already see a list of existing managers.

import AddManager from "/docs/guides/manage/console/_add_manager.mdx";

<AddManager name="AddManager" />


## Built-in register organization form

A basic form that allows a customer to enter an organization name and a user account is hosted on the follwing URL:
{custom-domain}/ui/login/register/org

When a user registers through this form, an organization and a user are created.
The user will automatically get the role "ORG_OWNER" withing ZITADEL and is able to manage the whole organization.
You can read more about the managers, roles and their meanings [here](/docs/guides/manage/console/managers)

### Disable built-in register organization form
If you do not want to allow users to register organizations with this form, you can disable it with the following request:
[Restrict the instance features](/docs/apis/resources/admin/admin-service-set-restrictions)

Disabling the form makes sense, if your administrators manage new customers themselves or if you build your own form.

## Build your own form with setup organization request

If the built-in register form doesn't fulfill your needs we recommend building your own form.

The administration API of ZITADEL, allows you to setup a new organization with a first administrator user.
The setup organization requests, has the possibility to specify an organization with its name and a domain.
You can directly send a human user with all the needed information like the profile, email, password. etc.
This request allows you only to setup a user with password authentication at the moment.
By specifying the roles you can define, which permission the user should have within ZITADEL.
Per default the user will automatically get "ORG_OWNER".

### Example Request

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://$CUSTOM-DOMAIN/admin/v1/orgs/_setup' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data-raw '{
  "org": {
    "name": "Organisation C",
    "domain": "org-c.com"
  },
  "human": {
    "userName": "gigi-giraffe",
    "profile": {

    },

    },

      "phone": "+41 71 000 00 00",
      "isPhoneVerified": true
    },

  },
  "roles": [

  ]
}'
```

Detailed description of [Setup Organization](/docs/apis/resources/admin/admin-service-set-up-org#setup-organization)

If you need to add custom data to either the organization or the user you can use the metadata.
Metadata is a key value construct that allows you to store any additional information to the ressources.
The set organization metadata request allows you to add one key value pair to an organization:
[Set Organization Metadata](/docs/apis/resources/mgmt/management-service-set-org-metadata)
If you have more than one field, you can use the bulk add request:
[Bulk Set Organization Metadata](/docs/apis/resources/mgmt/management-service-bulk-set-org-metadata)

The same requests also exist on the user ressource:
[Set User Metadata](/docs/apis/resources/mgmt/management-service-set-user-metadata)
[Bulk Set User Metadata](/docs/apis/resources/mgmt/management-service-bulk-set-user-metadata)
