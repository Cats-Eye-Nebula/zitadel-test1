Most applications need to know the identity of a user allowing to securely store user data in the cloud and provide the same personalised experience across all of the user's devices.

ZITADEL's authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users in your application. It supports authentication using passwords and applies additional security with the help of a second factor, for example OTP, to ensure a safe and secure access.
It additionally leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect such that it can be easily integrated in your custom backend.

This documentation demonstrates the different installation methods of ZITADEL and provides a quick start guide on how to register your organization as well as creating your first project.

## Trying out ZITADEL

### Installation Types

You can either use our cloud-instance [zitadel.ch](https://zitadel.ch) or deploy a dedicated **ZITADEL** instance. To get started, we recommend you to try out our free tier first.

### Use cloud instance zitadel.ch

To create a ZITADEL project, you have to register as an organization first. Click [here](https://accounts.zitadel.ch/register/org) to register.
You will receive an email prompting you to verify your mail.
Then go to your [Console Projects](https://console.zitadel.ch/projects) view and create a new project.

Now you can proceed adding users to your organization as well as integrating your applications. We refer to our guides as well as our [Quickstarts](../../quickstarts/introduction) to do so.

#### Verify your domain name (optional)

If you verify a domain you get the benefit that your organisations users can use this domain as the **preferred logonname**.

#### Elect Managers

ZITADEL allows you to give other users control over ZITADEL Console itself. This can be restricted to some kind of write and/or read. This can be especially useful for directing administration over several users. You can have managers able to edit project settings and others able to create/add users only.
Read the [guides](../introduction) for more information.

> Note: ZITADEL Managers are always located on the right sidepanel of console.

#### Integrating an application

After creating your project you can start integrating your applications.
After choosing your [project](https://console.zitadel.ch/projects) add a client application on the top of the page.
The wizard should provide some guidance what client is the proper for you. If you are still unsure consult our [Guide Project](projects).
