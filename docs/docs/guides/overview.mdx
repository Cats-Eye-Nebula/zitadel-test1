Most applications need to know the identity of a user for access control, to securely store their data in the cloud, and provide the same personalised experience across all of the user's devices.

ZITADEL provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users in your application. It supports authentication using passwords and applies additional security with the help of a second factor, for example OTP, to ensure safe and secure access.
It additionally leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect such that it can be easily integrated to your custom backend.

ZITADEL can be used in two ways:
- Use the ZITADEL Cloud, our public cloud service. Use the free tier to get started in minutes.
- Deploy a self-hosted ZITADEL for full control, wherever you like.
