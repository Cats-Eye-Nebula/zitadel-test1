## Business to Customer

B2C describes one of the simplest use cases in ZITADEL where we have an organization offering an application to customers like a Point of Sales website, having its customers as users in its organization.

The journey starts by creating an organization which is ZITADELS vessel for projects, roles, applications and users.
Depending on your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) you will have to create multiple organizations.

| Environment | Organization Name     | Description                                                                                                                          |
| :---------- | :-------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Development | **acme-dev**          | The development environment and organization |
| Testing     | **acme-test**         | An environment for testing and production preview |
| Production  | **acme-prod**         | The production environment and organization |


### Custom domain

Right after org creation you'll be greeted which the domain section of your organization. ZITADEL automatically creates a custom domain of the form `[orgname].zitadel.ch` on creation, but you can set your own by saving a verification file on the specified location.  

### User Authentication

The process of verifying a users identity is called User Authentication and is required in order for your users to access applications.
User Authentication can be performed in multiple ways, starting with the most basic one: Username Password. 
ZITADEL allows you to configure Multifactor Authentication in order to enhance security for your users. All methods including Identity Providers and Passwordless Authentication are starting from FREE Tier.
To setup your personal login policy, go to your organizations detail in [Console](https://console.zitadel.ch/org).
