:::tip What I need
I'd like to simply use ZITADEL without having to take care of any operational tasks.

Just register your ZITADEL instance in the ZITADEL Customer Portal //TODO: AddLink
Per default you will start in the [ZITADEL Free](https://zitadel.com/pricing) Tier, which already includes all the features.
You will immediately be able to integrate as many applications with as many users as you want. Serve your users multiple secure login methods for free.
