title: Technical Advisory 10004

## Date and Version

Version: 2.39.0

Date: 2023-10-14

## Description

Due to storage optimisations ZITADEL changes the behaviour of sequences. 
Sequences are no longer unique inside an instance.
From now on sequences are upcounting per aggregate id. 
For example sequences of newly created users begin at 1.
Existing sequences remain untouched.

## Statement

This change is tracked in the following PR: [new eventstore framework](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/5358).
As soon as the release version is published, we will include the version here.

## Mitigation

If you use the ListEvents API to scrape events use the creation date instead of the sequence.

## Impact

Once this update has been released and deployed, sequences are no longer unique inside an instance.
