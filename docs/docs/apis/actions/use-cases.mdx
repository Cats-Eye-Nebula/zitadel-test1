title: Use Cases
---

Actions are a powerful tool to extend ZITADEL and you might wonder what use cases actions can be used for.

This page provides a non-exhaustive list of possibilities which is provided by [examples](https://github.com/zitadel/actions/tree/main/examples). If a use case is missing feel free to contribute an issue or pull request to the repository, thanks in advance ðŸ¤—.

## Customize OIDC response

Append claims returned on OIDC requests.

### Triggers

- Complement token
  - [Pre Userinfo creation](./complement-token#pre-userinfo-creation-id_token--userinfo--introspection-endpoint)
  - [Pre access token creation](./complement-token#pre-access-token-creation)

### Set hardcoded claim

Extend the claims by a hardcoded value.

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/add_claim.js
```

### Set dynamic claim from user metadata

Extend the claims by dynamically read metadata from a user and sets the `picture`-claim if `idpPicture`-metadata value is present.

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/add_picture_claim_from_idp_metadata.js
```

### Set dynamic claim from organization metadata

Extend the claims by dynamically read metadata from an organization and sets the present metadata.

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/org_metadata_claim.js
```

### Custom role mapping in claims

Some products require specific role mapping from ZITADEL, no worries we got you covered ðŸ˜‰

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/custom_roles.js
```

## Customize SAML response

Append attributes returned on SAML requests.

### Triggers

- Complement SAMLResponse
  - [Pre SAMLResponse creation](./customize-samlresponse#pre-samlresponse-creation)

### Custom role mapping in attributes

Some products require specific role mapping from ZITADEL, no worries we got you covered ðŸ˜‰

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/set_custom_attribute.js
```

### Set dynamic attribute from organization metadata

Extend the attributes by dynamically read metadata from an organization and sets the present metadata.

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/org_metadata_attribute.js
```

## Manipulate user

You can automate manual tasks like setting default grants during user creation.

### Set email always verified

Useful if you trust the provided information or don't want the users to verify their e-mail addresses.

#### Triggers

- Internal Authentication
  - [Pre Creation](./internal-authentication#pre-creation)
- External Authentication
  - [Pre Creation](./external-authentication#pre-creation)

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/verify_email.js
```

### Add grants to users

Adding grants to users allows you to set default roles on users.

#### Triggers

- Internal Authentication
  - [Post Creation](./internal-authentication#post-creation)
- External Authentication
  - [Post Creation](./external-authentication#post-creation)

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/add_metadata.js
```

### Add metadata to users

Adding metadata to users allows you to set default metadata on users.

#### Triggers

- Internal Authentication
  - [Post Creation](./internal-authentication#post-creation)
  - [Post Authentication](./internal-authentication#post-authentication)
- External Authentication
  - [Post Creation](./internal-authentication#post-creation)
  - [Post Authentication](./internal-authentication#post-authentication)

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/add_user_grant.js
```

## Use provided fields of identity providers

If you want to ensure that the data of a user are always update you can automatically update user fields during authentication and safe time of your customers and your team. ðŸ¤¯

### Trigger

- External Authentication
  - [Post Authentication](./external-authentication#post-authentication)

### Fields provided by Okta

If you use [Okta as an identity provider](/guides/integrate/identity-providers/okta) you can improve the onboarding experience of new users by prefilling some basic information during authentication.

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/okta_identity_provider.js
```

### Fields provided by Gitlab

If you use [Gitlab as an identity provider](/guides/integrate/identity-providers/gitlab) you can improve the onboarding experience of new users by prefilling some basic information during authentication.

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/gitlab_identity_provider.js
```

### Fields provided by Github

If you use [Github as an identity provider](/guides/integrate/identity-providers/github) you can improve the onboarding experience of new users by prefilling some basic information during authentication.

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/github_identity_provider.js
```

### Claims provided by a generic OIDC identity provider

If you use a [generic OIDC identity provider](/guides/integrate/identity-providers/migrate#migrate-generic-oidc-provider) you can improve the onboarding experience of new users by prefilling some basic information during authentication.

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/set_idp_picture_metadata.js
```

### Attributes provided by a generic SAML identity provider

If you use a [SAML identity provider like mocksaml](/guides/integrate/identity-providers/mocksaml) you can improve the onboarding experience of new users by prefilling some basic information during authentication.

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/post_auth_saml.js
```

## Context aware execution

Based on the context the execution path of an action can change. ZITADEL allows complex execution paths of course. ðŸ˜Ž

### Based on auth request information

Execution paths might change based on the application initiating the authentication.

### Triggers

- Internal Authentication
  - [Pre Creation](./internal-authentication#pre-creation)
  - [Post Creation](./internal-authentication#post-creation)
  - [Post Authentication](./internal-authentication#post-authentication)
- External Authentication
  - [Pre Creation](./external-authentication#pre-creation)
  - [Post Creation](./external-authentication#post-creation)
  - [Post Authentication](./external-authentication#post-authentication)

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/execute_action_on_specific_app.js
```

This example uses [zitadel's log module](./modules#log)

### Check authentication error

Your action can also check for errors during the login process.

### Triggers

- Internal Authentication
  - [Post Authentication](./internal-authentication#post-authentication)
- External Authentication
  - [Post Authentication](./external-authentication#post-authentication)

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/post_auth_log.js
```

This example uses [zitadel's log module](./modules#log)

### Throw an error

If the execution path ends in an error ZITADEL handles the error based on the [configuration](/concepts/features/actions#how-it-works) of the action.

```js reference
https://github.com/zitadel/actions/blob/main/examples/throw_error.js
```
