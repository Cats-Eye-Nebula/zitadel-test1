title: APIs V2 (Beta)
---

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

APIs V2 organize access by resources (users, settings, etc.), unlike context-specific V1 APIs.
This simplifies finding the right API, especially for multi-organization resources.

**Note**: V2 is currently in [Beta](/support/software-release-cycles-support#beta) and not yet generally available (breaking changes possible). Check individual services for availability.

Once, V2 is generally available, it will adhere to the new [API style guide](/API_STYLE_GUIDE.md) and include these improvements:

- Improved RESTful API design with query parameters.
- Patching all resources and settings.
- Resource reusage with improved activation and deactivation experience.
- Search resources instance-wide by default.
- Enforced limits for search queries.
- Predefined and custom settings with inheritance per property.
