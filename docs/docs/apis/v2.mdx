title: APIs V2 (Beta)
---

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

APIs V2 organize access by resources (users, settings, etc.), unlike context-specific V1 APIs.
This simplifies finding the right API, especially for multi-organization resources.

**Note**: V2 is not yet generally available (breaking changes possible). Check individual services for availability.
