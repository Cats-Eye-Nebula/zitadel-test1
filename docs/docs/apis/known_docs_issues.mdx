## Generated Examples for oneOf Fields

The generated examples for mutually exclusive oneOf fields are not correct.

Let's take the [ListUserGrants docs](/docs/apis/resources/mgmt/management-service-list-user-grants) as an example.
The example suggests that the `queries` field is an array that takes only one single object which in turn takes all the possible queries in its object properties:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "offset": "0",
    "limit": 100,
    "asc": true
  },
  "queries": [
    {
      "projectIdQuery": {
        "projectId": "69629023906488334"
      },
      "userIdQuery": {
        "userId": "69629023906488334"
      },
      "withGrantedQuery": {
        "withGranted": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

However, the correct way to represent this is to have the queries as separate items in the queries array:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "offset": "0",
    "limit": 100,
    "asc": true
  },
  "queries": [
    {
      "projectIdQuery": {
        "projectId": "69629023906488334"
      }
    }, {
      "userIdQuery": {
        "userId": "69629023906488334"
      }
    }, {
      "withGrantedQuery": {
        "withGranted": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The [protoc grpc-gateway plugin generates OpenAPI v2 files](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/issues/441) that are used to generate the examples.
[OpenAPI v3 supports the *oneOf* keyword](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/oneof-anyof-allof-not/) but OpenAPI v2 doesn't.
The grpc-gateway plugin therefore just flattens the proto *oneof* fields into the messages properties where they are defined.
