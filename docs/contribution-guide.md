# How to contribute to Zitadel's documentation
Before you start your editing process please take some time to familiarise yourself with the rules for contributing to the documentation of Zitadel.

## Using captions
We urge you to always add captions to tables, graphics and images, unless the image is a logo or icon of any type. Also, inline graphics and images don't require captions due to readability.

Numbering is REQUIRED for captions. See next section.

## Numbering of captions
Numbering has to be continuous using arabic style numbers. The caption is composed of a Prefix and a descriptive text. The prefix is composed of the item type (Table, Image, Graphic), and incrementimg number in arabic style followed by a period.
Examples:

* Figure 1. Blah
* Table 21. Blob
* Image 13. Blort

## Inline graphics and images
Use sparsely.
